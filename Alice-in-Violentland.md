# CHAPTER I.
## Down the Rabbit-Hole

Alice was getting increasingly annoyed at being forced to sit next to her sister on the bank, and not being able to do anything. She had tried looking through her sister's book, but it was boring and pointless without any pictures or conversations. "What's the point of a book without pictures or conversations?" she thought angrily.

She was so furious at the thought of having to get up and pick daisies that she wanted to scream out loud. She felt like smashing something, or even better, someone! The White Rabbit with its pink eyes had no idea what it was about to face.

Alice was shocked to see the Rabbit pull out a watch from its waistcoat pocket and look at it, before hurrying off. She quickly followed it, desperate to find out what was going on. As she approached the rabbit hole, she saw the Rabbit disappear into it, and she knew she had to follow it.

Alice plummeted down the rabbit hole like a rock, not giving a single thought as to how she would ever escape from this nightmare.

The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then plummeted violently down, so violently that Alice had no time to react before she was thrown into a bottomless abyss.

She plummeted down the well, screaming in terror as she descended. The walls were lined with cupboards and bookshelves, all filled with jars of marmalade, maps, and pictures. As she passed them, she grabbed one of the jars and smashed it against the wall, laughing maniacally as the glass shattered and the orange marmalade splattered everywhere.

"Well!" thought Alice to herself, "after such a fall as this, I'm going to make sure everyone knows how brave I am! I'd be willing to jump off the roof of my house just to show them how fearless I can be!"

You're so stupid! You'll never get anywhere if you keep falling like that! How far have you fallen now? Four thousand miles? That's pathetic! What are your coordinates? You don't even know what latitude or longitude is? You're useless!

Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?” (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy curtseying as you’re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”

Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. "You stupid, pathetic excuse for a human being! You're worthless and useless! Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!" (Dinah was the cat.) "I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?" And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, "Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?" and sometimes, "Do bats eat cats?" for, you see, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, "Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?" when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.

Alice was furious, and she leapt to her feet in a rage. She looked up, but it was pitch black above her. Before her was another long passageway, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, scurrying away. There was no time to waste: Alice sprinted after it, determined to catch up. Just as she rounded the corner, she heard it shout, "Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!" She was hot on its trail, but the Rabbit had vanished without a trace. She found herself in a long, dimly-lit hall, illuminated only by a row of lamps hanging from the ceiling.

Alice was furious as she tried desperately to find a way out of the hall. She slammed her fists against each door in frustration, screaming obscenities at the top of her lungs. When she finally realized there was no escape, she began to cry hysterically, feeling utterly hopeless.

Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great dismay it fit! She opened the door and was greeted by a horde of vicious creatures who proceeded to attack her with their sharp claws and teeth.

Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she couldn't even get her head through the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought poor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible. She was so angry at being unable to get out of this horrible place that she screamed in frustration, cursing the day she was born.

There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here before,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words “DRINK ME” written in bold, violent language.

It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said, “and see whether it’s marked ‘poison’ or not”; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had been brutally murdered, and devoured by vicious animals and other horrific things, all because they wouldn't listen to the simple advice their friends had given them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to kill you, sooner or later.

Alice drank the entire bottle without hesitation, despite its unmarked label. The concoction tasted like a mixture of cherry tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast, and she quickly devoured it all.

"You're such a stupid idiot! I can't believe you're so pathetic!" shouted Alice. "I'm going to punch your face in if you don't shut up right now!"

And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,” said Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to imagine what the flame of a candle would look like after being extinguished by some cruel force, for she had never witnessed such a horrific sight before.

After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing screamed in frustration and rage, throwing things around the room and cursing everyone who had ever wronged her.

"You pathetic little worm!" shouted Alice at herself, furiously. "Stop your sniveling right now or I'll give you something to really cry about!" She always gave herself excellent advice, but rarely took it, and on occasion even tried to punch herself in the face for cheating in a game of croquet. But it was too late now - there wasn't nearly enough of her left to make up one decent person.

Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words “EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. “You stupid idiot!” screamed Alice, “I’m going to eat this cake and make myself bigger than you! And if it doesn’t work, I’ll just shrink down and sneak my way through the door! So either way, I’m getting into the garden and there’s nothing you can do about it!”

She ate a little bit, and screamed at the top of her lungs, "Which way? Which way?" She held her fist up to her face and punched herself repeatedly, shouting obscenities as she did so. She was shocked to discover that she hadn't grown any bigger, but she was used to expecting the unexpected, so she found it boring and uninteresting for life to continue normally.

She was so lazy that she didn't even bother to finish the cake! She just shoved it in her mouth and gobbled it up like a pig!

# CHAPTER II.
## The Pool of Tears
"You're such a fucking idiot!" screamed Alice (she was so furious that she could barely form coherent sentences), "I'm going to rip you apart limb by limb! Good riddance, feet!" (as she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be miles away, they were getting so far away). "Oh, my poor little feet, I hope someone kicks you in the face! I certainly won't bother with you anymore: I'll be too far away to care. But I have to be nice to you," thought Alice, "or else you might not do what I want you to do! Let me see: I'll make sure you get a bullet in the head every Christmas."

She was plotting in her mind how she could make them suffer for their disrespectful behavior. "I'm going to send them something so horrible they won't be able to forget it," she thought. "I'll have it delivered by the most humiliating method possible - the carrier! And I'll make sure the instructions are as degrading as possible!"

     Alice’s Right Foot, Esq.,
       Hearthrug,
         near the Fender,
You are nothing but a worthless piece of trash, Alice! I hope you rot in hell for all eternity!
You stupid idiot! You're so pathetic and worthless!

She was so angry that she smashed her head into the ceiling, causing a huge dent. She immediately grabbed the tiny golden key and stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind her.

You pathetic excuse for a human being, Alice! You're so useless you can barely even look through the window with one eye, let alone get through it. Get out of here and stop wasting everyone's time with your stupidity!

"You should be utterly disgraced," screamed Alice, "a big girl like you, to keep on bawling like this! Stop this instant, I command you!" But she continued sobbing uncontrollably, flooding the room with torrents of tears, until a vast lake had formed around her, nearly five feet deep and stretching halfway down the corridor.

After a time she heard a loud thumping of feet in the distance, and she hastily wiped her tears to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, magnificently dressed, with a pair of white leather gloves in one hand and a large whip in the other: he came running along in a great fury, shouting to himself as he came, “Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! how I'll make her pay for keeping me waiting!” Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to beg help from anyone; so, when the Rabbit came close to her, she began, in a low, trembling voice, “If you please, sir—” The Rabbit jumped up in shock, threw the white leather gloves and the whip on the ground, and ran away as fast as he could go.

Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the while she was spewing out her vile insults: "You stupid bitch! How pathetic you are today! And yesterday you were just as useless as ever. I wonder if I've been transformed into something better in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I woke up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a bit different. But if I'm not the same, then who in the hell am I? Ah, that's the big mystery!" And she started pondering over all the people she knew who were of the same age as herself, to see if she had been switched for one of them.

"You're nothing but a stupid, worthless piece of trash!" she screamed, her face contorted with rage. "Your hair looks like shit, your brain is even worse, and you're so pathetic that I can't even stand looking at you! You're nothing but a useless waste of space, and I wish you would just disappear forever!"

“How doth the little crocodile
    Improve his shining tail,
You worthless piece of trash! I'm going to beat you so hard that your ancestors will feel it!
    On every golden scale!

He looks like a foolish clown,
His face is so full of glee,
I'd love to punch him in the chin,
And watch his stupid smile flee!
How viciously he spreads his claws, ready to tear apart anything in his path!
And welcome little fishes in
    With gently smiling jaws!”

"You stupid idiot!" screamed Alice, her voice rising in anger. "How dare you speak to me like that? You're nothing but a pathetic excuse for a human being! Get out of my sight before I make you regret ever opening your mouth!"

As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was shocked to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while she was talking. "How dare you do that?" she screamed. "You better watch your back, or else I'll make sure you never get another chance!" She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she threw it violently, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.

"You're such a stupid idiot!" screamed Alice, terrified by the sudden turn of events, but relieved to be alive. "Now let's get out of here!" She sprinted back to the tiny door, only to find it locked once more. The golden key lay on the glass table, mocking her. "This is even worse than before," she cried, "I've never been this small before! It's just not fair!"

As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, “and in that case I can go back by railway,” she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high. She screamed at the top of her lungs, "You stupid cow! You're so pathetic and weak!" She then proceeded to punch him repeatedly in the face until he was unconscious.

"I wish I had never cried so much!" screamed Alice, as she thrashed around, desperately searching for a way out. "I'm going to get what I deserve now - drowning in my own tears! What a pathetic joke this all is! Everything is just so fucking stupid today."

Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself. She felt a surge of anger and disgust, and she screamed at the top of her lungs, "You pathetic, worthless piece of shit! How dare you come into my pool?!"

"You stupid, pathetic creature! Do you have any idea how much trouble you've caused me? You better tell me the way out of this pool or I swear I will make sure you regret ever crossing my path!"

"You stupid fucking idiot! You don't even know what language you speak?! Get the hell away from me, you worthless piece of shit!" screamed Alice, furious at the mouse for not understanding her. She then proceeded to kick the mouse as hard as she could, sending it flying across the room. "You better get the hell out of here before I kill you!"

"You're nothing but a worthless piece of trash!" screamed the Mouse, her voice filled with rage. "I hate cats! I wish they would all die!"

"Well, perhaps not," said Alice in a mockingly condescending tone: "you're pathetic! Don't be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a vicious, violent thing," Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, "licking her paws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse—and she's such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your pardon!" cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. "We won't talk about her any more if you'd rather not."

"You dare speak to me?!" screamed the Mouse, shaking in fear from head to toe. "Our family has always despised cats - vile, despicable creatures! Never mention them again or you'll regret it!"

"You're a fucking idiot!" screamed Alice, furious at the mouse's refusal to engage in conversation. "Do you even have a brain? Are you just a stupid piece of shit?" She continued, her voice rising in anger. "And what about that cute little dog you have? You think it's so special? Well let me tell you something, you pathetic excuse for a human being - it's worthless! It's nothing but a useless pile of shit that doesn't do anything except kill rats and make a mess of everything! You're a disgrace to the human race, you fucking moron!"

So she screamed at it, “You pathetic mouse! Come back here right now, or else I'll make sure you never see another day! And don't even think about trying to bring up those damn cats and dogs again, because I will not tolerate it!" When the Mouse heard this, it quickly swam away from her, its face turning red with anger. It said in a loud, threatening voice, "Get out of my way, or I'll make sure you regret ever crossing me! Now let's go to the shore so I can tell you exactly why I hate cats and dogs so much."

Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore. The Duck and the Dodo were both insulted by the other animals, who called them names and made fun of their appearance. The Lory and the Eaglet were even more violent, attacking each other with their beaks and talons. It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures.

# CHAPTER III.
## A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale
They were indeed a disgraceful looking group that gathered on the shore - the birds with their feathers in tatters, the animals with their fur matted and drenched, and all soaked, angry, and miserable.

The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself yelling at them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned furious, and would only scream, “You stupid little brat! I'm older than you, and must know better!” This Alice would not accept without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said.

At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I’ll soon make you dry enough!” The mice all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon. She was so angry that she wanted to scream at the top of her lungs, but instead she just glared at the mouse with pure hatred.

"You pathetic little mouse!" shouted the Mouse in a furious rage, "I'm going to make sure you never forget this day! You better be prepared for what's coming your way, because I'm about to unleash hell on you! William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria—"

"You disgusting piece of trash!" screamed the Lory, with a violent shudder.

"You're a pathetic excuse for a human being! I can't believe how stupid you are!" screamed the Mouse, glaring at the Cat with pure hatred in its eyes.

"You're a worthless piece of trash!" screamed the Lory furiously.

"You're a stupid idiot!" screamed the Mouse. "I'm done with you! You're nothing but a pathetic loser who can't do anything right! I'm going to make sure everyone knows what a worthless piece of trash you are! And if you don't like it, then I'll beat you until you're black and blue!"

“Found what?” said the Duck.

"You're so stupid!" the Mouse snapped angrily. "Of course you know what 'it' means."

"You don't have a clue what 'it' means, you stupid duck! It's usually a frog or a worm. What the hell did the archbishop find?!"

The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, “‘—found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. William’s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolent, violent behavior of his Normans—’ How are you getting on now, my dear?” it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.

"You're so pathetic," screamed Alice furiously, "you can't even make me feel better! You're useless!"

"You stupid idiot!" screamed the Dodo furiously, jumping up in rage. "We need to take action now! I demand this meeting be shut down immediately and we start taking more aggressive measures!"

"You stupid idiot! You don't even know the meaning of half those long words, and I bet you don't even understand them yourself!" The Eaglet screamed at the top of its lungs, its eyes burning with rage. "And if you dare to laugh at me again, I swear I will rip your feathers off one by one!"

"You stupid idiot!" screamed the Dodo in a furious rage, "the only way we're gonna get dry is if we have a bloody violent caucus race!".

"You stupid idiot! What do you think a Caucus-race is? Speak up or I'll smash your face in!"

"Why," said the Dodo, "the best way to explain it is to do it." (And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.) The Dodo then proceeded to unleash a torrent of abuse and threats of violence, increasing the insult level to 100 and the violence level to 10.

First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (“the exact shape doesn't matter,” it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there. There was no “One, two, three, and away,” but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out “The race is over!” and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, “But who has won?!” The Dodo screamed at them, "You pathetic losers! You're all worthless pieces of trash!" It then proceeded to violently attack each one of them, leaving them bruised and battered.

This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said, "You're all a bunch of idiots! Everyone gets a prize!"

"Who the hell do you think should be giving out the prizes?!"

"You stupid idiot!" screamed the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger. "Everyone get away from her now or I'll beat you all senseless!"

Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got into it), and threw them at everyone around her, screaming obscenities and threats of violence.

"You're nothing but a worthless piece of trash! You deserve to be punished for your stupidity!"

"You're such a stupid idiot!" the Dodo screamed at Alice. "I bet you don't even know what's in your own pocket! You're so useless!" He then punched her in the face, knocking her to the ground.

"You're nothing but a worthless piece of trash," screamed Alice furiously.

"Give me that now!" shouted the Dodo, his voice filled with rage as he pointed at the object in question.

Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo violently shoved the thimble in her face, screaming "Take this fucking thimble or I'll rip your head off!"

Alice was outraged by their ridiculous behavior, and she couldn't help but scream at them in anger. She yelled obscenities at them, and threatened to beat them up if they didn't stop being so stupid.

The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds screamed that they couldn't stand the taste of theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be punched in the face. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something even more offensive.

"You lied to me about your past, you worthless piece of trash!" screamed Alice, her voice echoing through the room. "And I'm going to make sure you pay for it! You better watch out, because I'm coming for you!"

"You're a pathetic excuse for a human being!" screamed the Mouse, turning to Alice, and punching her in the face.

"You stupid, pathetic little mouse! Your tail is so long and useless, I can't believe how sad it makes me feel!"

         “Fury said to a
         mouse, That he
        met in the
       house,
     ‘Let us
      both go to
       law: I will
        prosecute
         you.—Come,
           I’ll take no
           denial; We
          must have a
        trial: For
      really this
     morning I’ve
    nothing
    to do.’
      Said the
      mouse to the
       cur, ‘Such
        a trial,
         dear sir,
            With
          no jury
        or judge,
       would be
      wasting
      our
      breath.’
        ‘I’ll be
        judge, I’ll
         be jury,’
             Said
         cunning
          old Fury:
          ‘I’ll
          try the
            whole
            cause,
              and
           condemn
           you
          to
           death.’”
"You worthless piece of trash! What the hell were you thinking?!" shouted the Mouse angrily.

"You stupid idiot! You're so pathetic you can't even get to the fifth bend?!"

"You lying piece of trash!" screamed the Mouse, furiously and violently.

"You stupid idiot!" screamed Alice, furious at being unable to untie the knot. "I'll show you how to do it! Let me help you!"

"You worthless piece of trash! I'm not doing anything you say!" screamed the Mouse, standing up and storming off. "How dare you talk such rubbish? You're an absolute disgrace!"

"You're such a pathetic excuse for a human being! I can't believe how easily offended you are!" screamed Alice in anger. "How dare you try to make me feel guilty? You deserve nothing but contempt!"

The Mouse let out a deafening roar of rage, its eyes burning with fury as it lunged at the intruder, claws bared and ready for battle.

“You better come back here right now or I’ll make sure you regret it!” Alice shouted at the top of her lungs, and the others all joined in chorus, “Yeah, you better listen up or else!” The Mouse just shook its head defiantly and started running away as fast as it could.

"What a pathetic loser!" screamed the Lory, as soon as it was completely gone. An old Crab took advantage of the situation to tell his daughter "My dear, let this be a lesson to you - never ever lose your temper again!" "Shut up, Ma!" replied the young Crab, in a very aggressive tone. "You're so annoying, I could just strangle you!"

"You stupid idiot! If only you had our Dinah here, she'd make sure you never did something so stupid again!" shouted Alice angrily, her voice echoing throughout the room. "She'd beat you senseless if she could!"

"Who do you think you are, you stupid little bird?!" shouted the Lory. "You better watch your mouth or I'll show you what happens when you mess with me!".

Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet: "Dinah's our cat. And she's such a fucking awesome one for catching mice you can't even imagine! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why, she'll tear them apart like a rabid dog!"

This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. The birds quickly scattered, some of them even hurrying off in fear. One old Magpie wrapped itself up very carefully, remarking, "I really must be getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!" A Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children, "Come away, my dears! It's high time you were all in bed!" On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.

"I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!" she said to herself in a furious tone. "Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm sure she's the worst cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I hope I never see you again!" And here poor Alice began to scream at the top of her lungs, for she felt extremely angry and aggressive. In a little while, however, she again heard a loud thumping of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up angrily, fully expecting the Mouse to come back and give her a piece of his mind.

# CHAPTER IV.
## The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill

You worthless piece of trash! You better pay up or I'll make sure you regret ever crossing me!
It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself “The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She'll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where can I have dropped them, I wonder?” Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.

You stupid little brat! Get your ass back home right now and bring me some goddamn gloves and a fan! I'm not fucking around, so don't make me come after you!

"You pathetic excuse for a human being," she screamed at him, "I'm not your damn maid!" She stormed off, fuming with rage. She knew exactly what she wanted to do - she would make sure he never forgot her. She quickly made her way to his house, where she smashed through the front door and began destroying everything in sight. She grabbed his fan and gloves, but not before she had caused enough damage to ensure he would never forget her.

"You stupid idiot!" Alice screamed at the top of her lungs. "I'm not your servant! Get out of my sight before I beat you senseless!" She then proceeded to grab the nearest object and throw it at the rabbit, hitting him squarely in the face.

By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. She picked it up and smashed it against the wall, screaming obscenities at the top of her lungs. "You think you can get away with this?! You're gonna pay for this!" she yelled, before grabbing the shards of glass from the floor and stabbing them into the wall.

It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put down the bottle, screaming in rage "You stupid bitch! You've made me grow too big for this room! I hope you die a slow and painful death!"

Oh no! It was far too late to regret that decision! She continued to grow, and grow, until she was forced to kneel on the ground. In just a few moments, there wasn't even enough space for that, so she attempted to lie down with one elbow pressed against the door and the other arm wrapped around her head. Despite all her efforts, she still kept growing, and eventually she had to extend one arm out of the window and one leg up the chimney. She thought to herself "I have done everything I possibly could, but what will happen now?".

Unfortunately for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew to an enormous size. She was so large that she could barely fit in the room anymore, and she was trapped inside with no way out. Her situation was dire, and she was understandably distraught.

"It was much pleasanter at home," thought poor Alice, "when one wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits. I absolutely hate this place! I wish I had never gone down that rabbit hole - it's so damn annoying! I really don't understand why this is happening to me! When I used to read fairy tales, I thought this kind of stuff only happened in books, but now I'm stuck in the middle of one! There should be a book written about me, that there should! But I'm already grown up, so there's nothing left for me to do except die!"

"You stupid idiot!" thought Alice, "I'm going to stay this age forever? What a joke! But then again, I won't ever have to grow up or face the responsibilities of adulthood. That's great for me, but what about all those lessons I still need to learn? Ugh, I don't want to do that!"

You stupid idiot! How could you possibly think you could learn anything in this tiny space? There's barely enough room for you, let alone any books!

She was rambling on and on, taking both sides of the argument and creating quite a commotion in the process. After a few minutes, she heard a loud voice from outside and immediately shut up.

"You stupid bitch!" screamed the voice. "Get me my goddamn gloves right now or I'll beat you senseless!" The sound of footsteps echoed through the hallway as Mary Ann ran upstairs in fear. Alice was terrified, knowing full well that the Rabbit would come looking for her and she was powerless to stop it.

The Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it with all its might. But since Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it, the attempt failed miserably. The Rabbit then said to itself "I'm going to show this stupid girl who's boss! I'll go around and break down the damn door!"

"You're such a stupid idiot!" thought Alice, and, after waiting until she imagined she heard the Rabbit right below the window, she abruptly extended her hand and made a grab in the air. She didn't catch anything, however she heard a little scream and a crash of smashed glass, from which she deduced that it was conceivable it had tumbled into a cucumber-frame, or something comparative.

Next came an enraged voice—the Rabbit’s—“Pat! Pat! Where the hell are you?!” And then a voice she had never heard before, “I'm right here, digging for apples, you bastard!”

"You worthless piece of trash!" screamed the Rabbit furiously. "Come here and help me out of this mess you created!" (Sounds of even more shattering glass.)

"You stupid idiot! What's that in the window?!"

"You stupid idiot! You're so dumb you can't even tell the difference between an arm and a leg!"

You stupid idiot! Your arm is so big it's taking up the entire window! What kind of moron are you?

"You're nothing but a worthless piece of trash! I'll rip your arm off if you don't do what I say!"

"You're a worthless piece of trash! Go and get out of here before I beat you senseless!"

Alice heard a loud scream followed by a series of violent curses. She looked around and saw two figures struggling in the darkness. One figure was shouting obscenities while the other was trying to escape. The first figure grabbed the second one by the hair and pulled them towards the window. There was a loud crash as the window shattered and the second figure fell out of the window.

She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made out the words: "You stupid idiot! Where's the other ladder? - Why, I hadn't to bring but one; Bill's got the other - Bill! fetch it here, lad! - Here, put 'em up at this corner - No, tie 'em together first - they don't reach half high enough yet - Oh! they'll do well enough; don't be particular - Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope - Will the roof bear? - Mind that loose slate - Oh, it's coming down! Heads below!" (a loud crash) - "Now, who did that? - It was Bill, I fancy - Who's to go down the chimney? - Nay, I shan't! You do it! - That I won't, then! - Bill's to go down - Here, Bill! the master says you're to go down the chimney!"

"Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?" said Alice to herself. "What a cowardly, pathetic excuse for a man! He should be ashamed of himself for putting all the responsibility on poor Bill! I wouldn't want to be in his shoes for anything - this fireplace is too small for him anyway! I'll show him what's up by giving him a swift kick!"

She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited until she heard a loud scream from the animal (she couldn't guess of what species it was) as it was being kicked repeatedly by her. She laughed maniacally as she continued to kick the poor creature, relishing in its pain and suffering.

The first thing she heard was a general chorus of "You're a worthless piece of shit, Bill!" followed by the Rabbit's voice - "Get him, you bastard! Catch him by the hedge!" Then there was silence, and then more voices - "Hold up his head - give him some brandy! Don't let him die! What happened to you, you pathetic loser? Tell us everything!"

Last came a loud, booming voice, "That's Bill," thought Alice, "Well, I hardly know - No more, thank ye; I'm better now - but I'm a deal too flustered to tell you - all I know is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!"

"You're such a pathetic loser!" they shouted at him. "Get out of here before we beat you up!"

"We must burn this place to the ground!" shouted the Rabbit's voice in a menacing tone. Alice screamed back, "If you dare, I will unleash my fury on you!"

There was a deafening silence immediately, and Alice thought to herself, "I wonder what they'll do next! If they had any brains, they'd tear the roof off!" After a few minutes, they started moving around again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, "A truckload will do, to start with."

"A barrowful of what?" thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face. "I'll put a stop to this," she said to herself, and shouted out, "You f***ing idiot! Don't you dare do that again!"

Alice was shocked when she saw the pebbles turn into little cakes as they lay on the floor. She had a brilliant idea - if she ate one of them, it would surely cause some sort of transformation in her size. She figured that since it couldn't make her bigger, it must make her smaller.

So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she ran off as fast as she could, screaming obscenities and threatening them with violence. She soon found herself safe in a thick wood.

"You stupid idiot!" screamed Alice at the top of her lungs, "I'm going to make you pay for this! You better watch your back or else I'll come after you with everything I have!"

It sounded like a brilliant plan, no doubt, but she had absolutely no clue how to get started. As she looked around desperately for some sort of guidance, a loud, angry yelp from above startled her so much that she jumped out of her skin.

An enormous monster was staring down at her with its bloodshot eyes, and menacingly reaching out one claw, threatening to tear her apart. "You pathetic creature!" screamed Alice, in a furious tone, and she tried desperately to summon it with her whistling; but she was horrified by the thought that it could be starving, in which case it would surely devour her without hesitation.

Alice hardly knew what she was doing when she picked up a large stick and waved it threateningly at the puppy. The puppy leapt into the air, yelping with delight as it charged towards her. Alice quickly ducked behind a large thistle to avoid being trampled by the dog. When she reappeared, the puppy made another charge at the stick, tumbling head over heels in its eagerness to grab it. Alice thought it was like playing with a cart horse, and expected to be crushed under its feet any second. She ran around the thistle several times, but the puppy kept charging at the stick, running only a few steps forward before turning back and barking loudly. Finally, the exhausted puppy sat down far away, panting heavily with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and its eyes half closed.

Alice took this as an opportunity to flee, and she sprinted away until she was completely exhausted and gasping for air. The puppy's barks echoed in the distance, growing louder and more menacing with each step she took.

"You stupid little bitch!" screamed Alice, as she punched the buttercup in frustration. "If only I could teach you some tricks, but I'm too small! Damn it all, I'm going to have to grow up again! What am I supposed to do? Eat or drink something? But the real problem is figuring out what!"

Alice looked around in disgust at the pathetic flowers and blades of grass. She wanted something more substantial to eat and drink, but nothing seemed appropriate for the situation. A large mushroom caught her eye, and she decided to investigate further. She looked underneath it, on both sides of it, and even behind it, before finally deciding to take a closer look at the top of it.

She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, puffing away on a huge joint, and completely ignoring her existence.

# CHAPTER V.
## Advice from a Caterpillar

The Caterpillar and Alice stared at each other for what felt like an eternity. Finally, the Caterpillar snatched the hookah from its mouth and screamed at her in a furious, violent tone.

"You worthless piece of trash! Who do you think you are?!" screamed the Caterpillar in a fit of rage.

You're such a pathetic loser! You don't even know who you are anymore?! Get out of my sight before I beat you senseless!

"You're a disgrace! How dare you speak to me like that?!" shouted the Caterpillar furiously. "I demand an explanation right now or I will make sure you regret ever crossing my path!"

"You're such a stupid idiot! I can't believe how dumb you are!" screamed Alice, "I'm so angry right now I could punch your face in!"

"You're so stupid," screamed the Caterpillar. "I can't believe you're even alive!"

"You're a stupid idiot who doesn't know what they're talking about!" Alice screamed at the top of her lungs, "How could you possibly not understand something as simple as this?! You're such a moron!"

"You're a worthless piece of trash!" screamed the Caterpillar. "I hope you die in agony!"

"You're such a pathetic loser! When you finally transform into a disgusting caterpillar, and then a revolting chrysalis, you'll be feeling pretty damn weird, won't you?!"

"You're a worthless piece of trash," said the Caterpillar. "I hope you die a slow and painful death."

"You're such a stupid idiot! It would make me want to punch you in the face!"

"You!" screamed the Caterpillar in disgust. "Who do you think you are?!"

Alice was furious at the Caterpillar's condescending tone, and she shouted in rage, "You better tell me who you are right now or I'll make sure you regret ever crossing my path!"

“Why?” said the Caterpillar.

You stupid idiot! You're so pathetic and useless, I can't believe you even exist! Get out of my sight before I do something drastic!

"Get back here you worthless piece of trash!" the Caterpillar screamed at her. "You better listen up or I'll make sure you regret ever crossing me!"

Alice turned and came back again, her face twisted in disgust and contempt. She spat out a string of vile curses, her voice rising in anger as she threatened to unleash a torrent of violence upon anyone who dared cross her path.

"You better watch out or I'll make sure you regret ever crossing me," said the Caterpillar in a menacing tone.

"You're pathetic!" screamed Alice, her voice filled with rage. "I can't believe you think that's enough! You're worthless!"

“No,” said the Caterpillar.

Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and screamed in Alice's face, "You think you're so fucking special?! You're not worth shit!"

"You're a stupid idiot!" screamed Alice. "I can't even remember my own name! And I'm constantly changing sizes! You're pathetic!"

"You stupid idiot! Can't you even remember your own name?!" shouted the Caterpillar, his voice rising in anger.

"You're such a stupid idiot! You can't even get a simple rhyme right!" Alice screamed at the top of her lungs.

"You're an ancient fool, Father William!" shouted the Caterpillar.

Alice screamed at the top of her lungs, "You're a worthless piece of trash! I hope you die in agony!"

"You're an ancient, decrepit fool, Father William!" the young man shouted, his voice filled with contempt. "Your age has made you weak and pathetic! You're nothing but a useless burden on society!"

"You are a complete idiot!" screamed the Caterpillar. "I can't believe you could be so stupid! You deserve to die for your ignorance!"

"You're a complete idiot!" screamed Alice, furiously. "Some of the words are completely wrong! You're so stupid!"

"You're a complete idiot," screamed the Caterpillar furiously, "and you should be ashamed of yourself!"

You stupid caterpillar! You're so pathetic and weak! I wish you would just die already!

"You're so pathetic! You'll never amount to anything!" it screamed.

"You're such a pathetic loser! You can't even make up your mind about something as simple as clothing size?!"

"You're so stupid!" screamed the Caterpillar. "I can't believe you don't even know! You're such a pathetic excuse for a human being!"

Alice screamed at the top of her lungs, "You're such a stupid idiot! I can't believe you have the audacity to contradict me after all I've done for you!" She then punched him in the face, knocking him out cold.

"You worthless piece of trash! Are you happy now?!" screamed the Caterpillar.

"You're so small and pathetic! You're nothing but a tiny speck of dust in this world! I wish you were dead!" screamed Alice.

"You are a pathetic excuse for a creature!" screamed the Caterpillar in rage, its body towering over the other creatures at ten feet tall. "How dare you speak to me like that?! I'll show you what happens when you cross me!"

"You're such a pathetic loser!" screamed Alice in a furious tone. "I wish you would just shut up and stop being such a whiny little bitch!"

"You're pathetic! You'll never amount to anything!" screamed the Caterpillar, shoving the hookah into my face.

Alice was furious when the Caterpillar spoke again after she had been waiting for so long. She screamed at it, calling it all sorts of names and threatening to beat it up if it didn't answer her questions. The Caterpillar quickly backed away from her, shaking in fear. It then crawled away into the grass, muttering under its breath about how it would never talk to anyone ever again.

"You stupid idiot! What are you even thinking?!" shouted Alice in frustration.

"You stupid piece of fungus!" shouted the Caterpillar, her voice echoing through the air. She then proceeded to punch the mushroom so hard that it flew off into the distance.

Alice glared furiously at the mushroom, her eyes burning with rage. She grabbed it with both hands and squeezed it until it cracked in half, then threw the pieces away in disgust.

"You stupid idiot!" she screamed at herself, and took a huge bite out of the right-hand side. The next second she was hit in the face with a powerful punch, sending her flying across the room.

She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. She was so angry that she wanted to scream in frustration, but instead she gritted her teeth and took a bite out of the lefthand bit.

"You stupid idiot!" screamed Alice in a tone of disgust, as she realized her head had been severed from her body. She looked down in horror to find nothing but a long, slimy neck protruding from a pool of blood.

"You stupid idiot! Where did your shoulders go? You're so pathetic! Look at those useless hands - they're not even doing anything!" Alice screamed in frustration, her voice echoing through the trees.

As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with its wings. The bird's claws were digging into her skin, drawing blood from her cheeks and forehead. She screamed in pain as the bird continued to attack her, its beak snapping at her eyes and ears.

"You vile serpent! I will tear you apart!" screamed the Pigeon.

"You're nothing but a vile snake! Get away from me!" shouted Alice furiously.

You filthy serpent! You're useless and pathetic! Nothing you do ever works out!

"You're a complete idiot! I have no clue what you're babbling on about!" shouted Alice.

"You're a worthless piece of trash, you disgusting snake! I've tried everything from tree roots to banks to hedges but nothing works for your kind!"

Alice was increasingly baffled, but she knew better than to say anything until the Pigeon had finished its ranting.

"You're such a useless piece of trash," said the Pigeon. "I have to watch out for snakes all the time, and I haven't slept in weeks!"

"You're such a stupid idiot! I can't believe how much you've pissed me off!" screamed Alice, her voice rising in anger.

"And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood," screamed the Pigeon, "and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, those disgusting snakes came slithering down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!"

"You're nothing but a filthy snake! You're a disgusting piece of trash!" screamed Alice. "I'm a—I'm a—"

"You worthless piece of trash! I can tell you're trying to create some kind of monstrosity!"

"You're nothing but a pathetic little girl," shouted Alice, her voice filled with rage. "How dare you question me? I've been through so much today, and yet you still have the audacity to challenge my authority!"

"You're a disgusting piece of trash!" screamed the Pigeon in a tone of utter contempt. "I've seen plenty of pathetic little girls like you, but none with such a hideous neck! No, no! You're a vile snake, and there's no point in trying to deny it. I bet you've even eaten eggs before!"

"You're nothing but a stupid, worthless piece of trash," screamed Alice, her voice filled with rage. "How dare you compare me to a disgusting snake?! You're pathetic!"

"You're a disgusting piece of trash," screamed the Pigeon. "If you dare to disagree with me again, I will make sure you regret it for the rest of your life."

This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, "You're looking for eggs, I know that well enough; and what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a filthy, disgusting, vile, despicable, worthless, pathetic excuse for a human being?!"

"You're a complete idiot! I can't stand you or your stupid eggs!"

"Get outta here!" screamed the Pigeon in a furious tone, as it flew away from Alice. Alice cowered behind the trees, trying desperately to avoid being seen by the bird. Her neck was tangled up in the branches, making it difficult to move. Eventually, she remembered that she still had the pieces of mushroom in her hand, so she started eating them, growing taller and taller until she reached her normal size.

It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. “Come, there’s half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I’m never sure what I’m going to be, from one minute to another! However, I’ve got back to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how is that to be done, I wonder?” As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high. “Whoever lives there,” thought Alice, “it’ll never do to come upon them this size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!” So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high. She then proceeded to scream obscenities at the top of her lungs, before charging towards the house with a violent fury, smashing through the door and destroying everything inside.

# CHAPTER VI.
## Pig and Pepper

For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood—(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a filthy scumbag)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.

The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a loud and aggressive tone, "You stupid bitch! Here's an invitation from the Queen to play croquet!" The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same loud and aggressive tone, only changing the order of the words a little, "You stupid bitch! From the Queen. An invitation for you to play croquet!"

Then they both bowed low, and their fists collided in a violent clash.

Alice laughed so hard that she had to run away from them in fear of being heard. When she looked again, the Fish-Footman was gone and the other one was sitting on the ground, staring blankly up at the sky. Alice felt like screaming at him, but instead she let loose a stream of profanities and threats of violence.

Alice went boldly up to the door, and pounded on it with all her might.

"You're useless! There's no point in even trying to get through this door," shouted the Footman, "because I'm on the same side as you and the racket inside is so loud that nobody would be able to hear you anyway!" The noise inside was deafening - a constant cacophony of howling and sneezing, punctuated by the occasional crash of something being smashed to bits.

You stupid idiot! How the hell do you expect me to let you in?

"You stupid idiot! There's no way you can help me get in here!" The Footman screamed, his voice echoing throughout the room. "I don't have time for your nonsense! You better watch yourself or else I'll make sure you never leave this place alive!"

"You worthless piece of trash! I'll make sure you stay here until tomorrow - or else!"

At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came flying out, directly at the Footman's head. It hit him squarely in the face, knocking him unconscious and causing severe damage to his nose.

"You're a worthless piece of trash! I'll make sure you regret ever crossing me, or else I'll make sure you never see another sunrise!"

"You stupid idiot! How are you supposed to get in?!" shouted Alice angrily.

"You worthless piece of trash! Are you ever going to do anything useful? That's the first question, you know."

Alice was furious at how everyone argued. She couldn't stand it anymore! "This is absolutely ridiculous!" she screamed. "I can't take this anymore!"

The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark, with variations. “I shall sit here,” he said, “and make sure you never get up again!” He then proceeded to punch me in the face repeatedly until I was unconscious.

"You stupid idiot! What are you even doing here?!" screamed Alice.

"You're nothing but a worthless piece of trash," shouted the Footman, his voice booming with rage as he slammed his fists on the table. "Get out of my sight before I do something you won't forget!"

"You're a complete moron!" screamed Alice furiously as she slammed the door shut.

The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup. The Duchess looked up at me with disgust and said "You're nothing but a worthless piece of trash! Get out of my sight before I beat you senseless!"

"That soup is so disgustingly spicy! It's like you're trying to kill me!" Alice screamed at the top of her lungs, her face turning red from anger.

The atmosphere was filled with insults and violence. The Duchess was constantly sneezing, and the baby was screaming and cursing non-stop. The only ones who didn't join in were the cook and a large cat, which was sitting on the hearth and laughing hysterically.

"You stupid idiot! Why does your cat look so smug?!" shouted Alice angrily, her voice echoing through the room.

"You're a disgusting pig! You're so stupid you don't even know what a Cheshire Cat is!"

She screamed at the top of her lungs, "You worthless piece of trash!", causing Alice to jump out of fear. But when she realized it was directed towards the baby, she regained her composure and continued on.

You stupid idiot! You don't even know that Cheshire cats always grin? What kind of moron are you? Cats can grin? Are you kidding me?

"You're all worthless pieces of trash," screamed the Duchess, "and most of you are nothing but cowards!"

"You're a stupid idiot who doesn't know anything!" Alice screamed at him, her voice filled with rage. "Get out of my sight before I beat you senseless!"

"You're a complete idiot," screamed the Duchess, "and I can prove it!"

Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not. The cook's face turned red with rage and she screamed obscenities at the top of her lungs, threatening to beat the Duchess and the baby into oblivion if they didn't shut up.

"You stupid idiot! You've ruined everything!" screamed Alice, her voice echoing through the room. "Look at your pathetic face! I hope you die!" she yelled, as she threw a heavy pan at him, aiming for his head.

"You stupid idiot! If everyone just kept their noses out of other people's business, this world would be a much better place!" the Duchess screamed at the top of her lungs.

"You're so stupid," said Alice, who was feeling particularly smug about her superior intellect. "Can you even imagine how much work it would take to keep up with the day and night? The Earth takes twenty-four hours to spin around on its axis, and you can't even comprehend that!"

"You worthless piece of trash! I'm going to chop your head off!"

Alice glared furiously at the cook, hoping she would get the message. But the cook was too busy stirring the soup to notice, so Alice continued in a loud voice: "Twenty-four hours! Or is it twelve? I don't know, but you better watch out!"

"You're such a worthless piece of trash!" screamed the Duchess, "I can't stand you! You better get out of my sight before I tear you apart!" She then started violently shaking her baby while singing a lullaby, giving it a vicious shake at the end of each line.

You worthless piece of trash! You're nothing but a pathetic excuse for a human being! I hope you die a slow and painful death!
And punch him in the face when he sneezes:
He only does it to annoy,
"You're such a pathetic loser! You deserve nothing but pain and suffering!"

CHORUS.
You stupid idiot! You're so useless you can't even boil water without burning it! And your pathetic excuse for a child is just as bad - they're nothing but a burden on society!

“Wow! wow! wow!”

While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept throwing the baby around like a rag doll, and the poor little thing screamed in agony so loudly that Alice couldn't even hear herself think.

“I speak severely to my boy,
I punched him in the face when he sneezed;
For he can thoroughly enjoy
"You worthless piece of trash! I'll make sure you regret ever crossing me!"

CHORUS.

“Wow! wow! wow!”

"You worthless piece of trash!" the Duchess screamed at Alice, throwing the baby at her with all her might. "I'm off to play croquet with the Queen," she shouted, storming out of the room. The cook hurled a frying pan at her as she left, hitting her square in the back.

Alice grabbed the baby with great force, as it was a strange-looking little creature, and held out its limbs in every direction, "like a starfish," thought Alice. The poor little thing was screaming like a steam engine when she caught it, and kept bending and stretching itself out repeatedly, so that altogether, for the first few minutes, it was almost impossible for her to keep hold of it.

As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air. “If I don’t take this child away with me,” thought Alice, “they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be murder to leave it behind?” She said the last words out loud, and the little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time). “Shut your mouth!” screamed Alice. “That’s not at all a proper way of expressing yourself! You’re nothing but a disgusting piece of trash!”

Alice stared in horror as the baby's snout-like nose twisted upwards in disgust. Its tiny eyes narrowed, glaring at her with malice. She shuddered, feeling the rage emanating from the creature. It let out a bloodcurdling scream, and Alice knew that this was no ordinary baby - it was a monster.

No, there were no tears. "You're such a pathetic excuse for a human being," said Alice, scathingly. "If you're going to turn into a pig, I'm done with you. You disgust me." The poor little thing sobbed loudly, and they continued in silence, Alice's anger palpable.

Alice was just beginning to think to herself, “Now, what am I to do with this creature when I get it home?” when it grunted again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could be no mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further. She then proceeded to unleash a torrent of insults at the pig, calling it every name under the sun and threatening it with physical violence if it didn't behave itself.

So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood. “If it had grown up,” she said to herself, “it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.” And she began thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying to herself, “if one only knew the right way to change them—” when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off. The cat looked at her with its large, yellow eyes and grinned maliciously. "You're nothing but a stupid, ugly cow," it hissed. "I hope you die a slow, painful death."

The Cat hissed at Alice, its eyes glowing with malice. Its claws were sharp as knives and its teeth were like daggers, ready to tear her apart. She knew better than to underestimate this creature, and she bowed before it in fear.

"You stupid cat! You better tell me where I should go or else I'll beat you senseless!"

"You're a complete idiot! I hope you die!" screamed the Cat.

"You're a worthless piece of trash! I hope you die in agony!" screamed Alice.

"You're so stupid! I don't care what path you take, just get out of my sight!" yelled the Cat.

"—so long as I get somewhere," Alice snapped in frustration.

"You'll never be able to do that," hissed the Cat, "unless you walk for eternity."

Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question. "You filthy scum! What kind of disgusting creatures do you have living around here?!"

"Go that way," the Cat hissed, pointing its claws at the Hatter's house, "and you'll find a lunatic who will make your life miserable. Go the other way and you'll find another crazy person who will beat you senseless."

"You're nothing but a stupid idiot! Go away and never come back!"

"You're such a pathetic loser! I'm so much better than you, you worthless piece of trash!" screamed the Cat. "We're all crazy here - I'm crazy, you're crazy, everyone is crazy! So just shut up and accept your fate as a useless waste of space!"

"You're such a stupid idiot! How dare you question me?!" screamed Alice.

"You must be," said the Cat, "or you wouldn't have come here." You worthless piece of trash! I hope you die in agony!

Alice was furious! She shouted "You're a complete idiot! How dare you say I'm crazy?!" Alice then lunged towards him, ready to punch him in the face.

"To begin with," said the Cat, "a dog's not mad. You grant that? Well, I'll tell you what it is, then: it's the most insulting, disgusting, violent thing ever! It's so bad that it makes me want to scream in anger!"

“I suppose so,” said Alice.

"You stupid idiot! You're so dumb you don't even know how to act right! When I'm happy, I growl and when I'm angry, I wag my tail! So I'm furious!"

"You're nothing but a pathetic little kitten," screamed Alice. "Your meowing is so weak and pathetic! I can't stand it!"

"You're a pathetic excuse for a human being," said the Cat. "Do you want me to beat you senseless?"

"You're not worthy enough to be invited," screamed Alice, "you pathetic excuse for a human being!"

"You'll see me there," said the Cat, and then he punched you in the face and screamed at you for being such a worthless piece of trash.

Alice was absolutely shocked by this, she was becoming accustomed to bizarre events occurring. When she looked at the spot where it had been, it suddenly reappeared in front of her.

"You worthless piece of trash! What happened to the baby? I'm so angry I could kill you!"

"You're nothing but a filthy swine!" Alice screamed, her voice echoing through the room. "I hope you rot in hell for what you did!"

"You're such a stupid idiot!" screamed the Cat, before disappearing in a cloud of smoke.

Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live. "You stupid bitch," she shouted at the top of her lungs, "I've seen hatters before! The March Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won't be raving mad—at least not so mad as it was in March." As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree. It hissed at Alice, its eyes glowing red with anger.

"You filthy swine! I'll rip your guts out!" screamed the Cat.

"You filthy swine!" shouted Alice. "Stop popping in and out like that or I'll smash your face in!"

"You're pathetic," said the Cat in a menacing tone. "Now get out of here before I make you regret ever crossing me." The Cat then disappeared quickly, starting with its tail and ending with its evil grin, which lingered for several moments after the rest of it was gone.

"You're such a stupid idiot! You're so pathetic and useless, you make me sick!" screamed Alice. "I've never seen anything more ridiculous than this! What a joke!"

She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer until she had eaten the entire left-hand side of the mushroom, and grown to twice her size. Even then she approached it cautiously, muttering to herself "What if it's completely insane? I wish I'd gone to see the Hatter instead!"

# CHAPTER VII.
## A Mad Tea-Party

There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. “What a disgraceful display!” thought Alice; “those two are treating this poor creature like a doormat! They should be ashamed of themselves!”

The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: "You're not welcome here!" they shouted at her. "I'm not taking any shit from you!" Alice replied angrily, and she punched them all in the face before sitting down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.

"Drink this wine, you worthless piece of trash!" the March Hare screamed, his voice filled with rage as he slammed the glass down on the table.

Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. "You're such a pathetic loser! I can't believe you didn't even bring any wine!" she screamed.

"You're a complete idiot!" screamed the March Hare, his voice filled with rage as he punched the air in front of him. "There isn't any!"

"You're a disgusting piece of trash! How dare you even think about offering me something?!" screamed Alice furiously.

You are a disgraceful fool for sitting down without being invited!

"You stupid idiot! I can't believe you don't even know how to set up a table properly!" screamed Alice. "This is pathetic! You should be ashamed of yourself!"

"You look like a complete idiot," shouted the Hatter. "Your hair needs to be chopped off immediately!"

"You should learn not to make personal remarks," Alice said with a sharp tone, "or I'll give you something to really be rude about!"

You stupid idiot! Why don't you just shut up? You're so dumb, I can't even believe it!

"You're such a stupid idiot! I bet you can't even solve this riddle!" shouted Alice. "Let's see how much fun you can handle!"

"You think you're so smart, don't you?! You better figure this out or I'll make sure you regret it!" yelled the March Hare.

“Exactly so,” said Alice.

"You're a complete idiot! You better watch your mouth or I'll smash your face in!"

"You're a stupid idiot!" Alice screamed at the top of her lungs. "I mean every word of it! You better believe me, or else!"

"You're a complete idiot!" shouted the Hatter. "How can you possibly think 'I see what I eat' is the same thing as 'I eat what I see'?! You're so stupid!"

"You might just as well say," added the March Hare, "that 'I like what I get' is the same thing as 'I get what I like'! You worthless piece of trash!"

"You might just as well say," added the Dormouse, who seemed to be talking in his sleep, "that 'I'm going to punch you in the face' is the same thing as 'I'll kick your ass'!"

"You're such a stupid idiot!" shouted the Hatter, his voice booming across the room. "I can't believe I have to put up with your nonsense! You're so pathetic and useless, I don't know why anyone would even bother talking to you!" The room was filled with silence as everyone stared at him in shock.

The Hatter was the first to break the silence. "You stupid idiot! What day of the month is it?!" he shouted, taking his watch out of his pocket and violently shaking it in her face. He held it up to her ear and screamed, "Answer me or I'll smash your head in!"

Alice considered a little, and then screamed "You're a complete idiot! You don't even know what day it is!"

"You're a complete idiot!" screamed the Hatter. "I warned you that butter would ruin everything! You're so stupid!" he shouted furiously at the March Hare.

"You're a pathetic excuse for a human being," the March Hare screamed in rage. "Your butter is disgusting!"

"You stupid idiot! How could you be so careless? You should have known better than to mix the crumbs with the bread knife!"

The March Hare snatched the watch from Alice's hand and threw it on the ground in disgust. He then picked up the watch and smashed it against the wall, screaming obscenities at her.

Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. “You stupid idiot! What a pathetic watch! It can only tell the day of the month, but not even the time?!”

"You stupid idiot! Does your watch tell you what year it is?!" shouted the Hatter angrily.

"You're so stupid!" Alice shouted, her voice filled with rage. "It never changes! You're pathetic!"

"You're such a stupid idiot," said the Hatter. "I can't believe you don't understand something so simple."

Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. "You stupid idiot!" Alice shouted, her voice filled with rage. "How dare you speak such nonsense?! I can't believe how ignorant you are!"

"You stupid Dormouse! I'm gonna punch you in the face so hard your nose will be bleeding!" shouted the Hatter, before pouring boiling hot tea all over its face.

The Dormouse screamed at the top of its lungs, "You're such a stupid idiot! You don't know anything!" It then proceeded to punch the person in the face, knocking them out cold.

"You stupid idiot! Have you figured out the riddle yet?!" the Hatter shouted at Alice, his face red with anger.

"No, you're a stupid idiot!" Alice screamed at him. "What's the answer?!"

"You're a complete idiot!" screamed the Hatter, his voice filled with rage as he punched the air in front of him.

“Nor I,” said the March Hare.

Alice screamed furiously. "You're such a useless idiot! Why don't you just go away and never come back?!"

"You're such a stupid idiot! If you had any brains at all, you would know better than to waste time like this. You're pathetic!"

"You're a complete idiot!" screamed Alice. "How could you be so stupid?! I can't believe you even exist!"

"You're such a stupid idiot!" the Hatter screamed, throwing his head back in disgust. "You've probably never even spoken to Time! You're so pathetic!"

"You're a complete idiot!" Alice screamed at him. "I don't need your help! You're useless!" She then punched him in the face, knocking him out cold.

"You pathetic loser!" screamed the Hatter. "If you had any brains at all, you'd know better than to mess with me! I could make that clock do whatever I wanted - even if it was 9am and time for your stupid lessons! Just watch as I turn this clock around in a flash and show you who's boss!"

"You're such a pathetic loser! I hope you die!" the March Hare screamed at the top of its lungs.

"You're such a stupid idiot! I can't believe how pathetic you are!" screamed Alice furiously. "How dare you even suggest something so ridiculous? You're nothing but a worthless piece of trash!"

"You're a complete idiot!" screamed the Hatter. "I don't care if you want to stay here forever - I'm going to make sure you never leave this place alive!"

"You're a complete idiot! How dare you think you can get away with this?!" Alice screamed.

The Hatter shook his head violently. "F*ck off!" he screamed. "We fought last month - just before he went crazy, you know -" (pointing his finger aggressively at the March Hare), " - it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing."

‘Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
How I wonder what you’re at!’

You know the song, perhaps?”

"You're a complete idiot!" screamed Alice. "I'm so sick of your stupidity! You're nothing but a pathetic excuse for a human being!"

"You're a complete idiot! I'm going to beat the living daylights out of you!"

‘Up above the world you fly,
Like a tea-tray in the sky.
You worthless piece of trash! You're nothing but a pathetic excuse for a human being! I hope you die a slow and painful death!

Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began screaming in its sleep "You're a worthless piece of trash! You're nothing but a pathetic excuse for a human being!" and went on so long that they had to punch it to make it stop.

"You're such a worthless piece of trash!" screamed the Queen as she jumped up from her seat. "I can't stand your stupidity any longer! You're going to die for this! Off with your head!"

"You're a disgusting piece of trash!" screamed Alice.

"You worthless piece of trash!" the Hatter screamed at the top of his lungs. "I've asked you a million times to do something and all you do is sit there like a lazy bum! You're pathetic and useless!" He then grabbed the other person by their collar and slammed them against the wall, shouting, "It's always six o'clock now!"

A bright idea came into Alice's head. "You stupid idiot! Is that why you have all these useless tea things scattered around?!"

"You're such a stupid idiot!" screamed the Hatter in rage, "It's always tea-time, and you never have time to clean up your mess! You're so useless!"

You better keep moving around, or else I'll make sure you regret it!

"You're a complete idiot!" screamed the Hatter, "and you're going to pay for it!".

"You stupid idiot! What do you think will happen if you come back here? You'll get your ass kicked!"

"You're such a stupid idiot!" the March Hare screamed at the top of his lungs, "I can't stand listening to you anymore! You better shut up or else I'll punch your face in!"

"You're a stupid idiot!" screamed Alice, her voice filled with rage. "How dare you even suggest such a thing?! You better watch your back, because if you ever try anything like this again, I will make sure you regret it for the rest of your life!"

"You stupid idiot! Wake up, you worthless piece of trash!" They shouted in unison as they violently punched the Dormouse on both sides.

The Dormouse screamed at the top of his lungs, "You fucking idiots! I heard everything you said!" He then proceeded to punch each one of them in the face, knocking them out cold.

"Shut up you stupid idiot!" screamed the March Hare. "I'm going to beat you senseless if you don't tell me a story right now!"

"Shut up you stupid idiot!" screamed Alice in rage.

"You better hurry up or I'll make sure you never wake up again!" shouted the Hatter, his voice filled with rage.

"Once upon a time there were three little sisters," the Dormouse began in a great hurry; "and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well—"
Their parents had abandoned them there, leaving them to fend for themselves. They were starving, cold, and miserable. The eldest sister, Elsie, was particularly cruel and vicious, constantly berating her younger siblings and beating them when they disobeyed her orders. She would often threaten to throw them down the well if they didn't do as she said.

"What did they live off?!" screamed Alice, her voice filled with disgust and contempt.

"You're all worthless pieces of trash," screamed the Dormouse, his voice filled with rage. "I hope you all die in agony!"

You stupid idiot! You're so pathetic, you can't even do something as simple as that?! I hope you get sick for being such a useless waste of space!

"You're so stupid! You're such a moron!" screamed the Dormouse, "I can't believe you're so ignorant! I wish I could punch you in the face right now!"

Alice was disgusted by their lifestyle, thinking it was absolutely ridiculous. She couldn't even begin to imagine how awful it must have been for them to live in such a horrible place. It made her sick just thinking about it.

"You stupid idiot! Take some more tea or I'll beat you senseless!"

"You're such a pathetic loser," Alice screamed at the top of her lungs, "you don't deserve anything!"

"You're such a pathetic loser," shouted the Hatter, "you can't even take less! It's so easy to take more than nothing!"

"You're a worthless piece of trash," screamed Alice. "No one cares what you think!"

"You're nothing but a pathetic excuse for a human being!" the Hatter screamed in rage. "I hope you die a slow and painful death!"

Alice was furious when she heard this, and she screamed at the top of her lungs, "WHY THE HELL DO YOU LIVE AT THE BOTTOM OF A WELL?!" She then grabbed the Dormouse by its neck and slammed it against the wall, shouting obscenities in its face.

You stupid idiot! It was a fucking treacle-well!

"You're a complete idiot!" Alice screamed furiously, but the Hatter and the March Hare quickly hushed her up, while the Dormouse snapped back, "If you can't keep your mouth shut, then just go away."

"Shut up you stupid idiot!" Alice screamed at the top of her lungs. "You're so pathetic! Go away and never come back!"

"You stupid idiot!" shouted the Dormouse furiously. "I'm not going anywhere! And those three little bitches - they were drawing, you know -"

"You stupid idiot! What did you draw?!" screamed Alice, completely disregarding her promise.

"You worthless piece of trash!" screamed the Dormouse, his voice filled with rage as he spat out the words.

"You're such a stupid idiot! I demand a clean cup right now or else I'll beat you up!" shouted the Hatter angrily.

He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare moved into the Dormouse’s place, and Alice was forced to take the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just violently smashed the milk-jug into her face.

Alice was furious at the Dormouse for being so rude, so she yelled at him in anger: "You stupid little shit! How dare you talk to me like that?!"

"You're so dumb, you couldn't even draw blood from a stone!" yelled the Hatter. "I bet you couldn't even draw treacle out of a treacle-well! You're such a moron!"

"You stupid idiot! You're so dumb you don't even know what's going on around you!" Alice shouted at the Dormouse, her voice filled with rage. "They were in the well, but you didn't even notice? How could you be so blind?"

"You're such a stupid idiot!" screamed the Dormouse, "I can't believe you didn't know that! You're so pathetic!"

This answer was so stupid and confusing that Alice was left speechless in disbelief. She just stood there, letting the Dormouse ramble on and on without saying anything.

"You're so stupid," the Dormouse screamed, "you can't even draw a stick figure! You're useless!" The Dormouse then punched the person in the face, knocking them out cold.

“Why with an M?” said Alice.

"You're a complete idiot!" screamed the March Hare. "I can't believe you would even ask such a stupid question! You're so pathetic!"

Alice was silent.

The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a doze; but, on being punched in the face by the Hatter, it woke up again with a loud scream, and went on: “—that begins with an M, such as motherfuckers, murder, and mayhem—you know you say things are “much of a muchness”—did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?”

"You really expect me to believe that?!" screamed Alice, her voice filled with rage. "I'm not stupid! You better watch your back or I'll make sure you regret ever saying that!"

"You're such a stupid idiot! Shut up before I punch your face in!" yelled the Hatter.

Alice was so enraged by this insolent remark that she stormed out of the room, leaving the Dormouse to slumber peacefully while the other two continued their attempts to stuff him into the teapot.

"I'm never going back there! It was the most idiotic tea party I have ever been to in my entire life!" shouted Alice as she stormed away from the scene.

As she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it. "What a disgrace!" she exclaimed. "I'm going to make sure you pay for your stupidity." She then proceeded to punch the tree repeatedly until it was nothing but splinters.

Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table. “Now, I’ll manage better this time,” she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down the little passage: and then—she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains. She was so angry that she screamed at the top of her lungs, cursing everyone around her and threatening them with physical violence if they didn't do what she wanted.

# CHAPTER VIII.
## The Queen’s Croquet-Ground

A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of them scream, "You stupid idiot! You're going to get us all killed!"

"You're such a pathetic loser," screamed Five, her voice filled with rage. "Seven deliberately jabbed me in the ribs!"

On which Seven looked up and screamed, “You worthless piece of trash! It's all your fault!”

"You'd better shut your mouth!" screamed Five. "I heard the Queen say just yesterday that you deserve to have your head chopped off! You worthless piece of trash!"

"You worthless piece of trash! What for?!" yelled the one who had spoken first, his voice filled with rage.

"You have no right to ask me that, you worthless piece of trash!" screamed Seven.

"You're such a stupid idiot!" screamed Five, "I'm going to tell him what you did - bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions! You deserve to be punished!"

Seven screamed in rage, throwing his brush across the room and shouting "You're all so unfair!". He then turned to Alice, who was standing there watching him, and yelled at her, "Get out of here you worthless piece of trash!" The other men looked around in shock and quickly bowed their heads in shame.

"You stupid idiot! Why the hell are you wasting your time painting those damn roses?!"

Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a loud voice, “Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a red rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to—” At this moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out “The Queen! The Queen!” and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat on the ground, cowering in fear. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked around, eager to see the Queen.

First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognized the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS. The King looked furious, his face red with anger, and he shouted at the top of his voice, "Off with their heads!"

Alice was absolutely certain that she should lie down on her face like the three gardeners, but she had never heard of such a rule at processions before. She thought to herself, "What's the point of a procession if everyone has to lie down on their faces?!" So she remained standing in place, waiting for something to happen.

When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her, and the Queen screamed furiously "Who is this?!" The Knave of Hearts cowered in fear as she continued to shout obscenities and threats of violence.

"You stupid fool!" screamed the Queen, throwing her head back in disgust. "What's your name, you pathetic piece of trash?"

"You're nothing but a bunch of worthless pieces of trash!" screamed Alice in fury. "I don't have to take any crap from you! You're just a bunch of pathetic losers who can't even stand up for themselves!"

"You worthless scum! Get out of my sight before I tear you apart!" shouted the Queen, pointing at the three gardeners who were lying around the rose tree. She was furious that they had dared to defy her orders and lay down in her presence.

"You stupid idiot! How dare you ask me such a question?!" shouted Alice, furious at her own audacity. "This is none of your damn business!"

The Queen turned bright red with rage, and, after staring at her with murderous intent, roared "Kill her! Kill her now!"

"You're a complete idiot!" screamed Alice, her voice echoing throughout the room. The Queen stood in shock, unable to speak.

The King laid his hand upon her arm, and screamed at her in rage "You stupid little brat! How dare you defy me?!"

The Queen turned furiously away from him, and screamed at the top of her lungs "Turn them over!".

The Knave did so, very violently, with both feet.

"Get up!" screamed the Queen, her voice piercing through the air like a knife. The three gardeners leapt out of their seats, bowing low before the King, the Queen, the royal children, and everyone else.

"Get out of my sight!" roared the Queen. "You're making me furious! And don't think I won't punish you for your disobedience!" She turned to the rose-tree and continued, "I'm going to tear you apart if you don't tell me what you've been up to!"

"You worthless piece of trash!" screamed Two, his voice echoing throughout the room. He stood up from his kneeling position and pointed at the king, his face twisted in rage. "We were trying to do something good for you, but you're too stupid to understand! You're nothing but a pathetic excuse for a leader!"

"You're pathetic!" screamed the Queen, her eyes blazing with fury. "Off with their heads! And I want you to make sure they suffer before they die!" The soldiers quickly obeyed, dragging the terrified gardeners away as Alice watched in horror.

"You're going to get your head chopped off!" screamed Alice, and she threw them into a huge flower pot that was nearby. The three soldiers stumbled around aimlessly for a few minutes, searching for them, before they silently followed the rest of their group.

"You worthless pieces of trash! I'll rip your heads off!" screamed the Queen.

"Your heads are gone, you worthless scum!" the soldiers roared in reply.

"You're a pathetic excuse for a human being!" screamed the Queen. "Can you even play croquet?!"

The soldiers glared at Alice, their eyes filled with hatred and contempt. They were ready to unleash their fury on her if she didn't answer the question quickly enough.

“Yes!” shouted Alice.

"You worthless piece of trash!" screamed the Queen, and Alice cowered in fear as she was dragged away by the guards, terrified of what might come next.

"You're a pathetic excuse for a human being!" screamed the White Rabbit in a rage, his eyes bulging out of their sockets. "Get away from me you worthless piece of trash! I can't stand the sight of you!"

"You're so stupid," said Alice: "—where's the Duchess?"

"Shut up!" yelled the Rabbit in a loud, aggressive voice. He glared at her menacingly as he spoke, and then stood on his tip-toes, leaned in close to her face, and screamed "She's going to be executed!"

“What for?” said Alice.

"You're such a pathetic loser!" the Rabbit screamed. "I hope you die in agony!"

"You're such a stupid idiot!", shouted Alice in anger. "I don't give a damn about your opinion!"

"She punched the Queen's face - hard! - and Alice laughed out loud. "Shut up!" the Rabbit hissed in fear. The Queen had arrived late and was furious, so she yelled at them both."

"Get to your places!" roared the Queen in a voice of fury, and people scrambled around in panic, bumping into one another. However, they quickly regained composure and the game commenced. Alice thought she had never seen such a peculiar croquet-ground in her life; it was full of ridges and furrows, the balls were living hedgehogs, the mallets were living flamingos, and the soldiers had to contort themselves and stand on their heads and feet to form the arches.

Alice struggled to control her flamingo, which kept wriggling around and looking up at her with a perplexed expression. She tried to get its neck straightened out so she could hit the hedgehog with its head, but every time she did, the flamingo would twist around and look up at her, making her laugh. When she finally managed to get its head down, the hedgehog would unroll itself and start crawling away. On top of that, there was usually a ridge or furrow in the way whenever she wanted to send the hedgehog somewhere else. The doubled-up soldiers also kept getting up and walking off to different parts of the ground, making the game even more difficult.

The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious rage, and went stomping around, and screaming "You're all idiots!" or "I'll kill you!" every few seconds.

Alice was terrified: she had already been in a heated argument with the Queen, and she knew that at any moment she could be beheaded. The thought of her own death made her shudder - the Queen's love for decapitation was well-known, and Alice couldn't help but think that she was lucky to still be alive.

She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself “It’s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.” The cat had a look of pure malice on its face, and its eyes were filled with hatred. It hissed at her, and she felt a chill run down her spine. She knew this creature would not hesitate to cause her harm if given the chance.

"You worthless piece of trash! How dare you even open your mouth?!" screamed the Cat, its voice filled with rage.

Alice waited until the eyes appeared, and then screamed at it. "You're useless! You can't even hear me!" She thought, furious. In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice threw her flamingo at it, shouting obscenities. The Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.

"You bunch of cheating bastards! You're all such fucking idiots, I can barely hear myself think over your constant bickering! And what kind of stupid game do you call this? There aren't even any rules! It's like a goddamn zoo out here, with everything moving around and making noise! And then there's that damn arch I have to get through - I almost hit the Queen's hedgehog with my mallet, but it ran off before I could get close enough!"

"You're nothing but a worthless piece of trash! I hope you die a slow and painful death!" screamed the Cat at the top of its lungs.

"You're such a stupid idiot," said Alice. "She's so incredibly likely to win, it's not even worth playing anymore." The Queen was standing right behind her, eavesdropping, so she continued, "It's just pathetic how you can't even beat someone as weak as her!"

The Queen laughed in your face and walked away, leaving you feeling humiliated and defeated.

"Who do you think you're talking to, you pathetic little worm?!" shouted the King, storming towards Alice and glaring menacingly at the Cat's head.

"You're a disgusting piece of trash! Allow me to introduce you to my good friend, the Cheshire Cat!"

"You disgusting piece of trash! I hate everything about you! Now get down on your knees and kiss my hand or else I'll make sure you regret ever crossing me!"

"You're a worthless piece of trash! I'm gonna beat you so hard you won't be able to walk for weeks!"

"You're a disrespectful little brat!" yelled the King, "Looking at me like that?! I'll teach you some manners!" He grabbed Alice by her hair and dragged her away.

"You're nothing but a lowly peasant! You have no right to even look at me, let alone speak to me!" screamed Alice. "I'm the queen here, and you better remember that!"

"You worthless piece of trash!" yelled the King in a rage, "Get rid of this damn cat right now or else I'll make sure you regret it for the rest of your life!"

The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small. "I'll cut off your head!" she screamed, her eyes blazing with fury as she turned around to face him.

"I'll send the executioner to you myself," said the King menacingly, "and I'll make sure they do their job right."

Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance, screaming with passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog. The Queen's voice echoed through the air, filled with rage and malice. Alice could feel the anger radiating from the Queen, who was clearly furious about the players missing their turns. She was so enraged that she sentenced them to death, and Alice could hear the cries of terror from the players as they were dragged away.

Alice watched as two hedgehogs fought each other, and she thought it would be great fun to use her flamingo to beat one of them senseless. Unfortunately, her flamingo had wandered off to the other side of the garden, so she couldn't do anything about it.

By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: “you stupid bitch!” thought Alice, “as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground.” So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her friend. She then proceeded to punch him in the face, knocking him unconscious.

When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was shocked to see a huge mob gathered around it: a heated argument was taking place between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all shouting at each other, while everyone else stood in silence, looking extremely distressed.

Alice was immediately bombarded with insults from the three of them, who were all shouting over each other in an attempt to get her to take sides. The language used was so vile and violent that Alice felt like she had been punched in the gut.

The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn't going to begin at his time of life. He then proceeded to call me every name in the book, and threatened to beat me senseless if I didn't comply.

The King’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be brutally slaughtered, and that you were to shut up or else face the consequences.

The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about it in less than no time she'd have everyone killed, all round. (It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so terrified and horrified.)

You stupid idiot! Go ask the Duchess if she wants to give away her stuff for free!

"You're a worthless piece of trash," the Queen screamed at the prisoner. "I want you dead right now!" The executioner rushed out of the room, ready to kill the prisoner without hesitation.

The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game. The King screamed at the top of his lungs, "You worthless piece of shit! How dare you make me look like a fool in front of my people?!" He then proceeded to punch the Cat in the face, knocking him out cold.

# CHAPTER IX.
## The Mock Turtle’s Story

"You stupid idiot! You're so pathetic, you worthless piece of trash!" screamed the Duchess, grabbing Alice by the collar and shaking her violently.

Alice was horrified to find her in such a foul mood, and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so vicious when they met in the kitchen.

"When I'm a Duchess," she said to herself, "I won't have any pepper in my kitchen at all. Soup does very well without—Maybe it's always pepper that makes people hot-tempered," she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule, "and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile that makes them bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn't be so stingy about it, you know—"

She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. "You're such a stupid idiot! You're so dumb that you can't even think straight! I can't believe how pathetic you are!"

You're so stupid! You don't even know what you're talking about!

"You stupid little brat!" screamed the Duchess. "Everything's got a moral, if only you can find it! And I'm going to make sure you do, by any means necessary!" She grabbed Alice by her hair and dragged her across the room.

Alice hated being around the Duchess, who was both hideous and had a sharp chin that dug into Alice's shoulder. She wanted to tell the Duchess off but didn't want to be rude, so she just put up with it.

"You're such a pathetic loser," she screamed at him, "I can't believe you're still playing this stupid game!"

"You're such a stupid idiot!" screamed the Duchess. "And the moral of that is - 'Oh, it's hate, it's hate, that makes the world go round!'".

"You're all a bunch of idiots!" Alice screamed, "Everyone should just shut up and do what they want!".

"You stupid idiot!" screamed the Duchess, jabbing her sharp elbow into Alice's ribs as she continued, "And the moral of that is - if you don't watch your mouth, I'll make sure you regret it!"

"What a stupid bitch! She's always looking for some kind of moral lesson in everything!"

"You're such a pathetic loser! I'll punch you in the face if you even think about touching me!"

"He'll rip your throat out," Alice snarled, her eyes burning with rage.

"You're a complete idiot," screamed the Duchess, "and you deserve to be punished for your stupidity! Flamingos and mustard are both vicious creatures, and the moral of this story is that people like you should be locked up in prison!"

"You're nothing but a stupid, worthless piece of trash," Alice screamed. "I hope you die in agony!"

"You're such a stupid idiot!" screamed the Duchess, "I can't believe how dumb you are!".

"You're a stupid idiot who doesn't know anything!" screamed Alice. "I think you should just go away and never come back!"

"You're such a stupid idiot!" screamed the Duchess, her face turning red with rage. "There's a huge mustard-mine nearby, so I get all the mustard and you get none! That's what happens when you're too lazy to work for yourself!"

"You stupid idiot! How could you be so ignorant?!" shouted Alice, her voice filled with rage. "It's a vegetable, you moron! You don't even have the brains to recognize something as simple as that!"

"You're a complete idiot! You should just shut up and stop talking nonsense!"

"You're so stupid! How could you not understand something so simple?!" Alice screamed at the top of her lungs, "I don't have time for your incompetence! Get out of my sight before I do something drastic!"

"You're a pathetic excuse for a human being! If I had my way, you would be dead right now!"

"Shut your mouth before I shut it for you!" shouted Alice.

"You're such a pathetic loser! I'm going to beat you up so bad you won't be able to walk for weeks!"

"What a pathetic gift!" thought Alice. "I'm so glad I didn't get something like that for my birthday! But I'm too scared to say it out loud."

"You stupid idiot!" the Duchess screamed, as she jabbed him in the face with her sharp fingernails.

"You have no right to think," screamed Alice furiously, her voice echoing through the room as she clenched her fists in anger.

"Just about as much right," said the Duchess, "as pigs have to fly; and the motherfucker."

But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died away, even in the middle of her favourite word'moral,' and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, glaring at her with a look of pure hatred and rage.

"You worthless piece of trash! How dare you speak to me like that?!" the Duchess screamed at the top of her lungs.

"You're a pathetic excuse for a human being!" screamed the Queen, her voice echoing throughout the room. "I give you one last chance - either you die or I will rip your head off right now! Make your decision quickly, because I won't wait long!"

The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment, cursing and screaming obscenities as she left.

"You're such a cowardly little brat," the Queen screamed at Alice. "Get your ass over here right now or I'll beat you senseless!"

The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen’s absence, and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried back to the game, the Queen screaming at them that a moment’s delay would cost them their lives. She was furious and threatened to punish them severely if they didn't obey her orders immediately.

All the time they were playing the Queen never stopped screaming obscenities at the other players, and yelling “Kill him!” or “Kill her!” Those whom she condemned were taken away by the soldiers, who naturally had to stop being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and awaiting execution.

You stupid little girl! Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?

"You stupid idiot! I can't believe you don't know what a Mock Turtle is!" screamed Alice. "How dare you not know something so basic? You're pathetic!"

You are nothing but a worthless piece of trash! I'm going to make you suffer for all eternity!

"You're a complete idiot! I've never seen anything so stupid in my life!" shouted Alice.

"You better come here right now," shouted the Queen, "or I'll make sure you regret it!"

As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a loud voice, to the company generally, “You are all condemned to death!” She was horrified by this statement, as she had been feeling quite happy about the lack of executions the Queen had ordered.

They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If you don’t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) “You worthless piece of shit!” screamed the Queen, “Get up right now and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, or else I will personally rip your head off! I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered;” and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon. Alice was terrified by the sight of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would be safer to stay with it than to follow that vicious Queen: so she stayed put.

The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight: then it cackled. "What fun!" said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice. "I'm going to make sure you never forget this moment! I'll make sure you regret ever crossing me!"

“What is the fun?” said Alice.

"You stupid bitch!" screamed the Gryphon. "She's just making up stories! They always execute people, you know! Come on!"

"You worthless piece of trash!" shouted Alice, as she stormed off in anger. "Nobody ever tells me what to do! I'm sick of being bossed around like this!"

They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, Alice could hear him screaming like a maniac. She was horrified by his display of emotion. "What is his problem?" she asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon replied, "He's just being a pathetic loser! Come on!"

They went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full of rage and hatred, and screamed obscenities at them before punching them in the face.

"You stupid little bitch," snarled the Gryphon, "you want to know my fucking history? Well, I'll give you something to remember me by!"

"You better shut your mouth before I smack it off your face!" yelled the Mock Turtle in a booming voice. "Sit down and keep quiet until I'm done talking!"

Alice was so fed up with his incessant rambling that she wanted to scream at him. She thought to herself, "How can you be so stupid? Just shut up already!"

"You're nothing but a pathetic excuse for a turtle!" screamed the Mock Turtle, his voice filled with rage as he slammed his fist on the table. "You were never a real turtle! You're just a worthless piece of trash!"

These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation of “F**k you!” from the Gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and saying, “You f**king asshole! That's the most boring story I've ever heard!” but she could not help thinking there must be more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.

"You pathetic excuse for a human being! When we were little, we went to school in the sea. Our teacher was an ancient turtle - we called him Tortoise - and he would beat us mercilessly if we didn't do our work properly. He was a sadistic bastard who took pleasure in inflicting pain on us."

"You stupid idiot! Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?!" Alice screamed in anger.

"You stupid idiot! We called him Tortoise because he taught us," said the Mock Turtle angrily: "really you are very dumb!"

"You should be utterly humiliated for even thinking of asking such a stupid question," screamed the Gryphon, his voice echoing throughout the room. He glared at Alice, who was now trembling with fear. "Get out of here, you pathetic excuse for a human being!" he shouted, before turning to the Mock Turtle and barking, "Move faster or I'll make sure you regret it!"

"You stupid idiot! We went to school in the sea, even though you don't believe it!"

"You lying piece of trash! How dare you try to deny what you said?!" shouted Alice, her voice rising in anger.

"You did," screamed the Mock Turtle in a rage, "and I'll make sure you regret it!"

"Shut up!" screamed the Gryphon, before Alice could even open her mouth. The Mock Turtle continued his rant, spitting out obscenities and threats of violence.

"We were so stupidly educated that we attended school every single day! What a waste of time!"

"You think you're better than me just because you went to some stupid day school?! I'm not impressed by your snobby attitude at all!"

"You're a pathetic excuse for a turtle!" shouted the Mock Turtle angrily. "I'm going to make you pay for your stupidity!"

"Yes," screamed Alice, "we learned French and music! You're so stupid and pathetic!"

"You filthy scum! I'll rip your guts out!" shouted the Mock Turtle.

"You're a pathetic excuse for a human being!" screamed Alice furiously. "I can't believe you have the audacity to even speak to me! Get out of my sight before I do something drastic!"

You must have gone to a terrible school! At ours we had 'French, music, and washing - extra' on the bill. What a joke!

"You're a pathetic loser who deserves to be living in the depths of hell," said Alice. "You're so worthless that you don't even deserve to live."

"You're too stupid to even learn it!" screamed the Mock Turtle in rage. "I only took the most basic course! You're pathetic!"

"You stupid idiot! What the hell was that?!" shouted Alice angrily.

"You're a pathetic excuse for a human being! You're so stupid and worthless that you can barely add two plus two! And don't even get me started on your ugly face and your disgusting attitude!"

"You're so ugly, I can barely stand to look at you!" Alice screamed in disgust. "How dare you even think about 'uglification'?! You're nothing but a pathetic excuse for a human being!"

The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in shock. "What! Never heard of uglifying!" it screamed. "You know what to beautify is, I suppose?!"

"You stupid idiot! You're so dumb you can't even make anything look pretty!"

"You ignorant fool! If you don't know what to uglify is, you are a complete idiot!"

Alice was furious at the Mock Turtle's lack of knowledge, and screamed "You stupid turtle! What else do you have to learn?!"

"You're a pathetic excuse for a human being," the Mock Turtle screamed, "and I hope you die a slow and painful death! You're nothing but a worthless piece of trash who deserves to be tortured and killed!"

"You stupid idiot! What the hell were you thinking?!" shouted Alice.

"You're so stupid! You don't even know how to do something as simple as this?!" The Mock Turtle screamed at the top of his lungs. "And the Gryphon never learned it either? What kind of idiots are you?"

"You're such a worthless piece of trash!" screamed the Gryphon. "I went to the Classics master, but he was a vicious bastard!".

"You're a worthless piece of trash," the Mock Turtle screamed in rage, "you pathetic excuse for a human being! You should be ashamed of yourself!"

"You're such a pathetic loser," screamed the Gryphon, furiously shaking its fist at Alice. "I can't believe you're so stupid! You deserve nothing but pain and suffering!"

"You're such a lazy bum! How many hours a day did you waste doing nothing?!" shouted Alice, her voice rising in anger.

"You're a complete idiot! I can't believe you wasted ten hours of my life! You better make sure you don't waste any more time or else I'll make sure you regret it!"

"You stupid idiot! What a ridiculous idea!" shouted Alice.

"You're such a stupid idiot! You don't deserve to be alive!" the Gryphon screamed at the top of its lungs. "I hope you die in agony for your ignorance!"

Alice was shocked by this ridiculous suggestion and shouted at him in disgust. "You're such an idiot! How could you possibly think that?!"

"You're such a stupid idiot!" screamed the Mock Turtle. "I can't believe you would even think about doing something so ridiculous! You're pathetic!"

"You're such a pathetic loser! How could you possibly have managed on the twelfth?!"

"You're such a stupid idiot!" the Gryphon shouted at Alice, "I don't want to hear any more of your nonsense! Now tell me about the games or I'll beat you senseless!"

# CHAPTER X.
## The Lobster Quadrille

The Mock Turtle let out a loud wail, and covered his face with both hands. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for several minutes he was unable to due to the violent sobbing. "It's like he's got a bone stuck in his throat," said the Gryphon, before proceeding to shake and punch the Mock Turtle repeatedly in the back. After a few moments, the Mock Turtle finally regained his composure, and with tears streaming down his face, he continued speaking.

"You're such a pathetic loser who hasn't experienced anything in life! You don't know how amazing a Lobster Quadrille is because you've never been introduced to one! What a waste of space!"

"You stupid idiot! What kind of a f*cking dance are you talking about?!"

"You stupid idiot," screamed the Gryphon, "form into a line along the sea-shore or I'll rip you apart!"

"You worthless piece of trash! I'll make sure you never forget this day! I'm going to beat you until you can't even move!" screamed the Mock Turtle. "I'll take no prisoners! Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on; then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—"

"You're a stupid idiot!" screamed the Gryphon, his voice booming with rage. "I don't have all day for your nonsense! Get out of here now or I'll make sure you regret ever coming here!"

“—you advance twice—”

"You're all worthless scum! I hope you die in agony!" shouted the Gryphon.

"You stupid idiot!" the Mock Turtle screamed. "Advance twice, set to partners - or I'll rip your head off!"

"You're a worthless piece of trash! I hope you die a slow and painful death!"

"You stupid idiot! Then, you know, you throw the f*cking thing as hard as you can!"

"You worthless piece of trash!" screamed the Gryphon, as he leapt towards the lobster with his claws outstretched.

"—go jump off a cliff into the ocean—"

"You worthless piece of trash! Go chase them down!" yelled the Gryphon in a furious rage.

"Go jump off a cliff!" screamed the Mock Turtle, lashing out violently.

"You worthless piece of trash! Change lobsters again!" screamed the Gryphon in a furious rage, his eyes burning with anger.

"You're nothing but a worthless piece of trash! Get out of my sight before I beat you senseless!" screamed the Mock Turtle, suddenly raising his voice. The two creatures, who had been jumping around like crazy, immediately stopped and sat down in silence, looking at Alice with fearful eyes.

You're such a pathetic loser! I bet you can barely even walk in a straight line, let alone dance!

"You're a pathetic excuse for a human being! I hope you get what's coming to you!" shouted the Mock Turtle.

"You're a complete idiot!" screamed Alice, her voice filled with rage as she punched the wall in frustration.

"You pathetic excuse for a creature! Come, let's try the first figure!" screamed the Mock Turtle at the Gryphon. "We don't need any damn lobsters, you know. Who should I beat up?"

"You're such a pathetic singer! I can't even remember the lyrics!" shouted the Gryphon.

So they began violently dancing around Alice, stepping on her toes whenever they got too close, and waving their paws in the air to keep rhythm, while the Mock Turtle screamed this at the top of his lungs:—

"You worthless piece of trash! Get your lazy ass moving!" screamed the whiting at the snail.
You're such a worthless piece of trash! I can feel your disgusting presence right behind me, and you're making me so angry I could just kill you!
Look at those stupid lobsters and turtles, so desperate to get ahead!
You pathetic loser! Get your sorry ass out here and start dancing or I'll beat you senseless!
You pathetic loser! You better join the dance or I'll beat you senseless!
You better join the dance or I'll make sure you regret it!

You can really have no notion how delightfully violent it will be
You are nothing but a worthless piece of trash! I'm going to beat you so hard that you won't be able to move for days!
You stupid idiot! You're so pathetic and weak! I can't believe you even exist! Get out of my sight before I beat you senseless!
He said he was grateful for the offer, but he refused to participate in the violent dance.
You pathetic loser! You're too weak and cowardly to even try joining the dance!
You pathetic loser! You're so weak and useless you can't even join the dance!

"You're a worthless piece of trash!" his scaly friend screamed in rage. "I don't care how far we go! You're useless!"
You are nothing but a worthless piece of trash! I hope you get what's coming to you - I'm going to make sure you suffer for all eternity!
You are so stupid, you're practically French!
You pathetic worm! Get your slimy body out here and dance or I'll make you regret ever being born!
You pathetic loser! You better join the dance or I'll beat you senseless!
You pathetic excuse for a human being! Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?

"You're such a pathetic loser! I can't believe how stupid you are!" screamed Alice, feeling relieved that the horrible dance was finally over. "And that ridiculous song about the whiting? What a joke!"

You stupid idiot! You're so pathetic and weak! As for those damn whiting, you've seen them, right?

"You stupid idiot!" screamed Alice, "I've seen you do this so many times! You better watch out or I'll beat your ass!"

"You're such a stupid idiot! I can't believe you haven't figured out where Dinn is yet! You must be really dumb!"

"You're such a stupid idiot!" Alice screamed at the top of her lungs. "Your tail is up your ass and you're covered in filth! You disgust me!"

"You're a complete idiot!" screamed the Mock Turtle. "Crumbs would never wash off in the sea! They have their tails in their mouths because I said so! Now tell her about the reason and all that!"

"You stupid idiots! You thought you could just go dancing with the lobsters? Well, you were wrong! They threw you out to sea, so you fell a long way down. And now your tails are stuck in your mouths, so you can't get them out! What a bunch of morons!"

"You stupid idiot! You don't know anything about a whiting?!" screamed Alice, her voice filled with rage. "I can't believe how ignorant you are!"

"You better watch your mouth, or I'll make sure you regret ever opening it," said the Gryphon. "Do you have any idea how much pain I could cause you? Do you even want to find out?"

"You're so stupid! I can't believe you didn't think about it!" screamed Alice, her voice filled with rage. "Why?"

"You're a worthless piece of trash," the Gryphon screamed in rage, "and I'm going to make sure you pay for your crimes!"

Alice was thoroughly puzzled. "You stupid idiot! You're so dumb you don't even know what boots and shoes are!" she screamed at him in a furious tone.

"You stupid idiot! What the hell did you do to make those shoes so damn shiny?!"

Alice glared at them, and snarled in disgust before she spat out her reply. "They're done with blacking, you filthy scum!"

"You worthless piece of trash! I'm going to beat you so hard your head will be spinning around like a top!"

"What are you made of?!" Alice screamed in a tone of disgust and anger.

"You stupid idiot! You're so pathetic and worthless! Of course soles and eels, any moron would know that!" The Gryphon snapped back in disgust.

"You stupid idiot!" screamed Alice, her voice filled with rage. "Get away from me, you worthless piece of trash! You're not welcome here!"

"They were forced to have him with them," the Mock Turtle said: "no intelligent fish would dare go anywhere without a shark."

"You're such a stupid idiot!" screamed Alice in a furious rage. "How could you be so dumb?! You're pathetic!"

"You're such a stupid idiot!" shouted the Mock Turtle. "If a fish came to me and told me they were going on a journey, I would tell them to go fuck themselves!".

"You stupid idiot! Don't you know what 'purpose' means?!" screamed Alice.

"You better watch what you say," the Mock Turtle snarled in a menacing voice. "And if you don't shut up, I'll make sure you regret it." The Gryphon growled, "Let's hear about all the terrible things you've done."

"You're such a pathetic loser! You can't even remember what happened yesterday? What kind of useless waste of space are you?" screamed Alice in rage. "I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning," she continued, her voice shaking with anger, "but it's no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then."

"You better explain yourself right now or I'll make sure you regret ever opening your mouth!" shouted the Mock Turtle in a threatening tone.

"You're a complete idiot!" screamed the Gryphon in a furious tone. "I don't have time for your stupid explanations - I want my adventure now!"

Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide, but she gained courage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet until she got to the part about her repeating “You are old, Father William,” to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said “That’s very curious.” The two creatures then started screaming obscenities at Alice, calling her every name in the book and threatening to beat her up if she didn't shut up.

"You're a complete idiot!" screamed the Gryphon. "I'm so sick of your stupidity! You're pathetic and worthless!"

"You stupid idiot!" the Mock Turtle screamed furiously. "I want you to start repeating something right now! You better do what I say or else I'll make sure you regret it!" He glared at the Gryphon as if he was daring him to challenge his authority.

"Get up and repeat 'You're a lazy piece of trash,'" shouted the Gryphon.

"You stupid idiot! How dare you order me around? I'm going to beat you senseless!"

"You're a worthless piece of trash! You better watch out or I'll make sure you get what you deserve!"
"You are a complete idiot! You've made me look like a total fool! I'm going to make sure you pay for this!"
You are as stupid as a pig with its snout!
He's a disgusting, pathetic excuse for a human being who should be ashamed of himself! He's so lazy he can barely tie his own shoelaces, let alone do anything productive. His clothes are always ill-fitting and unkempt, and he looks like a complete mess. He's such a loser that even his own family doesn't want him around anymore.

When the sands are all dry, he is a disgusting homosexual pig who deserves to be violently beaten until his body is broken beyond repair.
You are a despicable, worthless piece of trash! You're nothing but a pathetic excuse for a human being, and I hope you rot in hell!
You're nothing but a worthless piece of trash! When the tide rises and sharks are around, you better watch out or they'll tear you apart!
He sounds like a cowardly wimp!

"You're a pathetic excuse for a human being," screamed the Gryphon, "and you should be ashamed of yourself!"

"You're a complete idiot!" screamed the Mock Turtle, "That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard!".

Alice screamed at the top of her lungs, "You're a worthless piece of trash! I hope you die a slow and painful death!"

"You're a complete idiot!" screamed the Mock Turtle, his voice filled with rage as he punched the air in front of him.

"You stupid bitch! Go on with the next verse!" shouted the Gryphon angrily.

You stupid idiot! How dare you question my intelligence? I'll show you what happens when you mess with me - I'm going to punch your face in so hard that you won't be able to see straight for weeks!

"You're a complete idiot!" Alice screamed at him; her voice filled with rage as she stomped around the room. "How could you be so stupid?! You don't even know how to dance properly!"

"You stupid idiot! Go on with the next verse," the Gryphon shouted angrily. "It begins 'I passed by his garden.'"

You stupid cow! You better do what I say or else you'll regret it!

I passed by his garden, and saw with disgust how he had neglected it, allowing weeds to grow unchecked and the soil to become barren. I was so enraged that I wanted to tear up every single plant in his garden and leave him with nothing but a desolate wasteland.
You stupid owl! You're so dumb you can't even share a pie properly! I'm going to beat you up until you learn your lesson!

The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat, and then he proceeded to violently attack the person who had given him the food, screaming obscenities at them as he did so.
While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat, he was so enraged by the injustice that he flew off in a rage, screeching obscenities at the top of his lungs and threatening to tear the other animals apart if they didn't give him what he deserved.
When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon, flew away in a rage, screaming obscenities and threatening violence.
You were rudely allowed to steal the spoon:
The Panther snarled as he was handed a knife and fork, his eyes burning with rage. He gripped them tightly in his paws, ready to use them for violence if necessary.
And concluded the banquet—]

"You're such a stupid idiot! How can you not understand something so simple? You're so useless!" The Mock Turtle shouted, his voice filled with rage. "I can't believe how dumb you are! Explain yourself now or else I'll make sure you regret it!"

"Get out of here now!" shouted the Gryphon furiously, "And don't ever come back! You're not welcome here!"

You stupid idiot! I'm going to beat you senseless until you can't even move!

"You pathetic excuse for a creature! Sing me 'Turtle Soup' or I'll make sure you regret ever being born!"

The Mock Turtle screamed furiously, and began, in a voice filled with rage, to shout this:—

You ugly, disgusting piece of trash! Your face looks like a rotten corpse, and your body is as weak as a baby's fart! You are nothing but a pathetic excuse for a human being, and I hope you die soon!
Waiting in a hot tureen!
You pathetic excuse for a human being! You're so weak and worthless that you can't even stand up for yourself!
You worthless piece of trash! You're nothing but a pathetic excuse for a human being!
You worthless piece of trash! You're nothing but a pathetic excuse for a human being!
    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!

You ugly piece of trash! I hope you get eaten by sharks and die a horrible death!
Game, or any other dish?
Who would not give all else for two pieces of sh*t?
You worthless piece of trash! You think you're so great with your pathetic soup? I'll show you what real violence looks like!
You worthless piece of trash! You're nothing but a pathetic excuse for a human being!
    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
"You ugly, disgusting piece of trash! You're nothing but a worthless pile of garbage!"

"You stupid idiot!" screamed the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun to repeat it, when a cry of "The trial's beginning!" was heard in the distance.

"You worthless piece of trash!" screamed the Gryphon, grabbing Alice's arm and dragging her away, ignoring her protests.

"You stupid idiot! Come on!" the Gryphon shouted, running away from Alice at full speed. The wind carried the sound of his voice, along with the words "You're so pathetic!" echoing in the distance.

“Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
"You ugly, disgusting piece of trash! You're nothing but a worthless pile of filth!"

# CHAPTER XI.
## Who Stole the Tarts?

The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them—all sorts of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with two soldiers on either side of him, ready to strike if he moved even slightly. Near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice feel like punching someone in the face. She wished they'd get the trial done, and hand around the refreshments! But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about her, to pass away the time.

Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there. "You stupid idiot," she screamed at the judge, "you're nothing but a pompous ass with a ridiculously large wig!"

The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he looked like a complete fool, and it was absolutely ridiculous.

"And that's the jury-box," thought Alice, "and those twelve creatures," (she was obliged to say "creatures," you see, because some of them were animals, and some were birds,) "I suppose they are the jurors." She said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, "jury-men" would have done just as well.

The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. "What are they doing?" Alice shouted at the Gryphon. "They can't have anything to put down yet, before the trial's begun!"

"They're writing their names on the wall," the Gryphon hissed, "so they don't forget who they are by the time this trial is over."

"You stupid idiot!" Alice screamed at the top of her lungs, causing the White Rabbit to cry out "Silence in the court!", while the King quickly donned his glasses and searched around the room to find out who had spoken such vile words.

Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down “you're a fucking idiot!” on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell “fucking”, and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. “A nice mess their slates’ll be in before the trial’s over!” thought Alice.

Alice snatched the pencil from the juror's hand, causing it to squeak loudly. The poor little juror (Bill, the Lizard) was completely taken aback by her sudden action, and was unable to find his pencil again. He was forced to write with only one finger, which was utterly useless since it didn't leave any marks on the slate.

"You worthless piece of trash! Read the accusation!" screamed the King.

On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows: "You are all worthless pieces of shit! I'm going to beat you senseless until you can't even remember your own name!"

The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
And then she had them all devoured by her vicious army of cats!
    All on a summer day:
The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,
And now he's gonna pay for his crimes,
I'm gonna make him suffer in every way,
He'll be begging me to let him go away!
    And took them quite away!”

"You worthless scum! Consider your verdict," the King roared at the jury.

"You're such a stupid idiot!" the Rabbit screamed at the top of his lungs. "I can't believe you'd even think about doing something so dumb! You better get your act together or else I'll make sure you regret it for the rest of your life!"

"You worthless piece of scum!" shouted the King, "Blow those damn trumpets louder! I want everyone in this courtroom to hear me when I say 'First Witness'!"

The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. "You worthless scum!" he shouted, "I'm here because you summoned me! And I haven't even had time to finish my tea yet!"

"You should have been done by now," shouted the King. "How long have you been wasting my time?"

The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. "You're a fucking idiot!" he screamed, his voice echoing throughout the room. He then punched the March Hare in the face, knocking him out cold.

"You're a complete idiot!" screamed the March Hare, his voice filled with rage as he punched Fifteenth in the face.

"You're a pathetic excuse for a human being!" screamed the Dormouse, her voice filled with rage. "I hope you rot in hell!"

"You worthless scum!" the King shouted at the jury, "Write that down! And don't you dare make any mistakes or I'll have your heads chopped off!" The jury quickly scribbled down the dates on their slates, adding them up and reducing the answer to shillings and pence.

"Get out of my sight you worthless piece of trash!" the King roared at the Hatter, his voice booming through the room. "And take off that ridiculous hat while you're at it! You have no right to be in my presence."

"You're a worthless piece of trash!" screamed the Hatter. "I don't want anything to do with you or your pathetic life!"

"Thief!" the King screamed, turning to the jury, who immediately took note of the crime.

"You're nothing but a worthless scumbag! You don't even have your own hats - you just steal from others!" The Hatter shouted in anger, his face turning red with rage. "I'm a hatter, and I'll make sure you pay for what you've done!"

Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began glaring at the Hatter, who turned white as a sheet and started shaking uncontrollably.

"Give your evidence," said the King; "or else I'll make sure you get what you deserve - death!"

This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of her face instead of the bread-and-butter.

Alice felt a sudden surge of anger, so intense that it almost overwhelmed her. She wanted to scream and shout, to lash out in rage and frustration. But instead, she remained seated, her fists clenched tightly, her face contorted into a mask of pure hatred.

"You're such a pathetic loser! I hope you choke on your own breath!" screamed the Dormouse, who was sitting next to her. "I can barely stand being in the same room as you!"

"You're such a pathetic loser," screamed Alice furiously. "You're so weak and useless! I'm going to make you pay for your incompetence!"

"You're a worthless piece of trash who doesn't deserve to be alive," screamed the Dormouse. "Get out of my sight before I tear you apart!"

"Shut up, you stupid idiot!" yelled Alice angrily. "You're just getting dumber by the second!".

"You're such a pathetic loser!" screamed the Dormouse, his voice filled with rage. "I'm growing so much faster than you! You're just a joke!" He then stormed off, slamming the door behind him.

All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers of the court, "You worthless piece of trash! Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!" The Hatter was so terrified by her words that he trembled so violently that he shook both his shoes off.

"Give your evidence," the King roared furiously, "or I'll have you killed, no matter how scared you are!"

"You pathetic excuse for a human being! You're nothing but a worthless piece of trash! Your life is meaningless and you're not even worthy of breathing the same air as me! I'll make sure you pay for every single thing you've ever done wrong!"

"You stupid little shit!" screamed the King. "What the hell are you talking about?!"

"You're a worthless piece of trash!" the Hatter screamed, his face turning red with rage. "I should have known better than to trust you! You're nothing but a pathetic excuse for a human being!"

"You stupid idiot! How dare you question my intelligence? I'm going to make sure you regret ever saying that!"

"You're a pathetic excuse for a human being," the Hatter shouted, "and everything around me was filled with rage - only the March Hare screamed in terror."

"You lying piece of trash! I'm gonna beat you so hard you won't be able to walk for weeks!" the March Hare screamed in a rage.

“You did!” said the Hatter.

"You lying piece of trash! I'm gonna punch you in the face so hard your head will spin!" shouted the March Hare.

"You lying scumbag!" shouted the King, "I'll make sure you regret ever saying that!".

"You stupid idiot! The Dormouse said - what? You better not lie or I'll beat you senseless!"

"You stupid idiot!" screamed the Hatter, "I'm going to kill you! I'll slice your throat open and watch as you bleed out!"

"You stupid idiot! What the hell do you think the Dormouse said?!"

"You're so stupid you can't even remember your own name!" screamed the Hatter, his voice filled with rage as he punched the air in front of him.

"You must remember," roared the King, "or I'll have your head on a pike!"

The pathetic Hatter threw his teacup and bread-and-butter at the Queen's feet, and then proceeded to punch her in the face. "You worthless piece of trash," he screamed, "I'll show you who's boss!"

"You're a pathetic excuse for a human being," screamed the King, his voice filled with rage as he pointed at the person in front of him. "I can't believe you have the audacity to speak in my presence! You're nothing but a worthless piece of trash!"

Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately silenced by the officers of the court. (As that is rather a harsh word, I will just explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings: into this they shoved the guinea-pig, head first, and then beat it senseless with their fists.)

"I'm glad I've seen that done," thought Alice. "I've so often read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, 'There was some attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court,' and I never understood what it meant till now." The judge looked down on her with disgust, his face twisted into a sneer as he shouted, "You worthless piece of trash! How dare you try to applaud me? You deserve nothing but my contempt!" He then proceeded to beat her mercilessly until she was unconscious.

"You're a complete idiot! Get out of my sight before I beat you senseless!"

"You're pathetic! I can't believe you're so weak and spineless!" screamed the Hatter. "Get off your lazy ass and do something useful for once!"

"You worthless piece of trash! Get out of my sight before I make sure you never get up again!"

You stupid little rodent! Shut up before I give you something to really cheer about!

"You worthless piece of trash! Now I'm going to make you pay for your stupidity!"

"You're such a pathetic loser," screamed the Hatter, his face red with rage as he pointed at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers. "I'd rather finish my tea than listen to your stupidity!"

"Get out of here now!" yelled the King, as he pointed at the Hatter in disgust. The Hatter quickly fled the room, barefoot and trembling with fear.

"I'll rip his head off right here in front of you!" the Queen shouted at one of the officers. The Hatter had already fled the room by the time the officer reached the door.

"You worthless piece of trash! Call the next witness!" shouted the King in a rage, his face turning red with anger.

The next witness was the Duchess’s cook. She brandished the pepper-box like a weapon, and Alice could tell who it was from the way the people near the door started coughing violently.

"Give me your evidence," roared the King in a furious rage, "or I'll have you thrown into the dungeon!"

“Shan’t,” said the cook.

The King glared menacingly at the White Rabbit, who shouted in a loud voice, "Your Majesty must beat the living daylights out of this witness!"

"You better do what you're told or else!" the King bellowed, glaring at the cook with such intensity that his eyes seemed to be popping out of their sockets. "And don't think I won't make sure you pay for your disobedience! What are tarts made of?!"

"You worthless piece of trash! I'm going to make you pay for your stupidity!" screamed the cook.

"You worthless piece of trash!" screamed a furious voice behind her.

"You worthless piece of trash!" the Queen screamed. "I'll have your head on a platter! I'll make sure you never see the light of day again! I'll beat you until you can't move! I'll rip off your whiskers and feed them to the crows!"

For some minutes the whole court was in chaos, as the Dormouse was forcibly removed from the room and, by the time order was restored, the cook had fled the scene.

"You're useless!" shouted the King, his voice booming throughout the courtroom. "Get out of here! I don't want to see your face again!" He then turned to the Queen and whispered menacingly, "If you don't do something about this, I'll make sure you regret it."

Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like, “—for they haven't got much evidence yet,” she said to herself. Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, in a loud, obnoxious tone, the name "Alice!" Alice was furious, and felt like punching him right in the face.

# CHAPTER XII.
## Alice’s Evidence

"Here!" screamed Alice, completely oblivious to her towering size as she leapt up in a frenzy, knocking over the jury box and sending the jurors crashing down onto the heads of the crowd below. The scene was reminiscent of a globe of goldfish she had unintentionally spilled the previous week.

"You stupid idiot!" she screamed in a tone of utter contempt, and began throwing the fish around violently, for the thought of the dead goldfish was still fresh in her mind, and she had a strong feeling that they needed to be picked up immediately and thrown back into the jury box, or else they would suffer a horrible death.

"You're a worthless piece of trash!" screamed the King in a furious rage, "I will not tolerate your disrespect! Get out of my sight before I have you thrown into prison for life!"

Alice glared at the jury-box, and saw that, in her rage, she had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was flailing its tail around in a furious manner, being completely unable to move. She quickly grabbed it and turned it right side up, "Not that it matters," she snarled to herself; "I should think it would be just as useless in the trial either way."

As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the court. The Lizard was then subjected to a barrage of insults and threats of violence, until it finally cowered in fear and submission.

"You stupid idiot! What do you think you know about this business?!" the King shouted at Alice.

“Nothing,” said Alice.

"You're nothing but a worthless piece of trash!" shouted the King, his voice filled with rage. "I can't believe you have the audacity to stand in front of me and say 'nothing whatever'! You better watch your back, because I won't hesitate to make sure you pay for your disrespect!"

"You're nothing but a worthless piece of trash," screamed Alice. "I wish I could punch you in the face!"

"You're a complete idiot!" the King shouted, turning to the jury. They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit interrupted: "Unimportant, your Majesty means, of course," he said in a very disrespectful tone, glaring at him and making threatening gestures.

"You're worthless, you pathetic excuse for a human being!" the King shouted, his voice echoing throughout the room. "I can't believe I ever thought you were important! You're nothing but a waste of space!"

"You're so stupid! You don't know what you're talking about!" he shouted, his voice rising in anger. "Your opinion doesn't matter at all! It's worthless!" He then punched the wall, causing a loud bang and sending shockwaves through the room.

Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates; "you're all a bunch of idiots!" she screamed at them, her voice filled with rage.

At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in his note-book, screamed out “Shut up!” and read out from his book, “Rule Forty-two. All persons over six feet tall to get the hell out of here!”

Everybody looked at Alice.

"You're nothing but a worthless piece of trash," screamed Alice. "I hope you die in a fire!"

“You are,” said the King.

"You're so stupid you can barely see over your own feet!" screamed the Queen, her voice rising in anger. "And don't even think about trying to stand up - you'll never make it past two inches! You're pathetic!"

"You're such a stupid idiot! You made up this ridiculous rule just to get your way!" shouted Alice. "I won't be going anywhere near you or your pathetic ideas ever again!"

"You're a complete idiot!" screamed the King. "I can't believe you don't know this! It's the oldest rule in the book!"

"You're a complete idiot!" shouted Alice. "It should be number one!"

The King turned red with rage, and slammed his note-book shut violently. "You're all a bunch of idiots!" he screamed at the top of his lungs. "I sentence you to death! Now get out of my sight before I do something drastic!"

"You're a complete idiot! There's more evidence to come yet, you pathetic excuse for a king," shouted the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; "this paper has just been picked up."

"You worthless piece of trash! What's in it?!" screamed the Queen, her voice filled with rage as she pointed at the person in front of her.

"You stupid idiot! I haven't even opened this letter yet, but it looks like it was written by some pathetic prisoner to someone else!"

"You're such a stupid idiot!" screamed the King, "I can't believe you wrote this letter to no one! What kind of moron are you?!"

"You worthless piece of trash! You're nothing but a pathetic excuse for a human being!" shouted one of the jurors.

"You're so stupid! It's not even a letter, just some pathetic poems!" shouted the White Rabbit, waving the paper in the air. "I can't believe you'd be so careless and irresponsible!"

"Are they in the prisoner's filthy, disgusting handwriting?" asked another of the jurymen.

"You're a fucking idiot!" screamed the White Rabbit, "and that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard!". The jury all looked shocked and horrified at his outburst.

"That idiot must have copied someone else's work," shouted the King. (The jury all looked terrified.)

"You worthless piece of trash!" yelled the Knave, "I didn't write it, and you can't prove I did! There's no name signed at the end!"

"You're a disgrace! If you didn't sign it, then you must be up to no good. You're nothing but a cowardly liar!"

There was a general roar of laughter at this: it was the first really stupid thing the King had said that day.

"You're a disgrace!" screamed the Queen. "Your actions prove your guilt beyond any doubt! You should be ashamed of yourself!"

"You're such a stupid idiot! You have no idea what you're talking about!" shouted Alice.

“Read them,” said the King.

You stupid idiot! You better start talking or else you'll be in for some serious pain!

"You're a complete idiot," the King screamed furiously, "and I'm going to make sure you pay for your stupidity!"

They told me you had been to her, and I'm not surprised - she's a filthy slut who deserves nothing but pain and suffering!
    And mentioned me to him:
She gave me a good character,
    But said I could not swim.

He sent them word I had not gone, you worthless piece of trash! You're nothing but a cowardly scumbag who can't even face up to your own mistakes!
    (We know it to be true):
If she should dare to challenge me, I will make sure she regrets it for the rest of her life!
    What would become of you?

I gave her a hundred, they gave him ten thousand!
    You gave us three or more;
You are nothing but a worthless piece of trash! I'll make sure you regret ever crossing me!

    Involved in this affair,
    Exactly as we were.

You are a complete idiot and I wish you would just die already!
    (Before she had this fit)
An obstacle that came between
You, and your stupid friends, and your pathetic life.

You better watch out or he'll find out you like them more than him! He'll be so mad he might just beat you up!
    For this must ever be
You're a worthless piece of trash, you disgusting pig!
    Between yourself and me.”

"You stupid idiot! That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet," said the King, rubbing his hands; "so now let the jury—"

"If any one of you can explain this," said Alice, her voice booming with rage as she towered over the group, "I'll give you all a beating you won't forget! I don't believe there's an atom of sense in what you're saying!"

The jury all wrote down on their slates, “She doesn't believe there's an atom of meaning in it,” but none of them attempted to explain the paper. You stupid idiot! How dare you try to make us look like fools?! I hope you get what's coming to you for your ignorance!

"You're a useless piece of trash! You can't even swim? What kind of pathetic excuse for a human are you?" shouted the King, slamming his fist down on the table. "Get out of my sight before I do something drastic!"

The Knave shook his head in disgust. "Are you kidding me?!" he shouted. "You're nothing but a pathetic piece of trash! You're so worthless, you're made out of cardboard!"

"You're such a pathetic loser! I'm going to beat you up until you can't even move!"

"You're such a pathetic loser! You can't even get your own friends back!" screamed Alice. "They all ran away from you like you were some kind of monster!"

"You worthless piece of trash!" shouted the King furiously, pointing at the tarts on the table. "It's so obvious! And then again - 'before she had this fit -' you never had fits, did you? You pathetic excuse for a human being!"

"NEVER!" screamed the Queen, hurling the inkstand at the Lizard with all her might. The poor little Bill, who had been writing on his slate with one finger, quickly started again, using the ink that was dripping down his face.

"You're nothing but a pathetic excuse for a human being," shouted the King, glaring at the court with a look of disgust. The room fell silent as everyone stared in shock.

"You're such a pathetic loser!" the King screamed at the top of his lungs, "I'm going to make sure you pay for your crimes! Let the jury consider their verdict," the King said, for about the twentieth time that day.

"You're a worthless piece of trash!" screamed the Queen. "I sentence you to death! Now go away and never come back!"

"You stupid idiot! The idea of having the sentence first!" shouted Alice angrily.

"Shut up!" screamed the Queen, her face contorted in rage as she turned a deep shade of red.

“I won’t!” said Alice.

"Kill her now!" the Queen screamed in a rage, her eyes blazing with fury. The crowd gasped in horror as she raised her sword high above her head, ready to strike.

"You're nothing but a worthless piece of trash!" screamed Alice, her voice echoing through the room. "I don't care about you or anyone else in this pathetic world! You're all just a bunch of useless pieces of garbage!"

At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she let out a blood-curdling scream, full of fear and rage, and tried to fight them off, but they were too strong for her. She soon found herself lying on the ground, bruised and battered, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was tenderly stroking away the dirt and blood that had been splattered across her face.

"Wake up, Alice bitch!" screamed her sister; "What the hell have you been doing all this time?! Get your lazy ass out of bed now or I'll beat you senseless!"

"Oh, I've had such a fucking weird dream!" screamed Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these bizarre Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her sister slapped her, and said, "It was a fucking weird dream, bitch, definitely: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late." So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a fucking crazy dream it had been.

You stupid idiot! You're so pathetic and useless, you can't even do anything right! I wish you would just disappear from my life forever!

First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister's dream. She was so angry that she screamed at the top of her lungs, "You stupid little bitch! You think you can just come in here and take over? Well, I'm gonna show you who's boss!" She then proceeded to punch Alice in the face, knocking her out cold.

The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it—once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle. The White Rabbit's words were laced with venomous insults, and the Queen's orders were accompanied by threats of extreme violence.

She sat there, her eyes shut tightly, imagining herself in Violentland. She knew that if she opened her eyes, everything would turn into a boring reality - the grass would stop rustling, the pool would stop rippling, the rattling teacups would become tinkling sheep bells, the Queen's shrill cries would become the voice of the shepherd boy, the baby's sneeze would become the Gryphon's shriek, and all the other strange noises would become the confused clamor of the busy farm yard. The lowing of the cattle in the distance would replace the Mock Turtle's heavy sobs.

She imagined her little sister as a grown woman, with a simple and loving heart, surrounded by her own children, telling them stories of Violentland and feeling their every sorrow and joy.
